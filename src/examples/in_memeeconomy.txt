Why was the n-word necessary here exactly?
Especially if you had class with one of your crushes. You’d pick up all the boxes. 
Yo, quick question, no clue where to ask so decided to go for a hot post, is the person who uploads an investable template allowed to invest in it?
Damn y'all really serious bout yer memes huh?
How does anyone even think this, are these made by 6th graders? 
Don’t see how this can be versatile :(

I can really see potential in this one. Made an investment of 10,000 but I might throw in more. 
Can we get a blank version so the format has reuse potential?

Crop your shit, dumbass.
Haven’t seen an undertale meme in god knows how long
REEEEEEEEE don’t invest!
This is huge, all in.
Very strong start could get to front page with enough support.
I’m in favor of this as both an investor/creator. I would want a cap however. 10% of the trillions and beyond is a lot of coin and would probably keep me from creating content from a sheer self-esteem/self-worth perspective.
~~Should you~~ You should reply to the mod's post requesting ideas ~~?~~ .
The new update actually added quite a lot so it's much better than what it used to be. This meme is kinda pointless rn

Just like the simulations
Old meme, dead
1) no, it's only 4 hours, and in order to get a decent profit you have to invest in post with less than 20 upvotes, so search by new is a must!

2) it's just as a roleplay, for the fun of it, think of us like proper investors and you need to try to sell us your memes.

3) that's the main focus, we invest on meme format, not the meme itself, so it needs to be versatile and adaptable to different uses.
Answer for number 3: Meme economy is not only for investing, but you’re supposed to upvote formats because that’s what you’re “buying”
Answer to number 1: No. Only works 4 hours at a time. If you don't invest early (below 30 upvotes) your returns will be modest, even if the post gets huge. 
1.  There is currently no way to change the time of investment return, but it has been suggested for  season 2  (aka the next  financial year  if you will) and may be added as well as a smorgasbord of other edits.

2.  There's no real buying or selling, it's just investing.  In a sense, selling a meme would be the equivalent of someone suggesting to not invest while buying would be the equivalent of someone suggesting that you do invest.

3.  The sub is for memes and meme formats.  There is some internal strife amongst some users about what that means, but the short of it is that both get posted often and you can invest in whatever you feel like.
That text is gross
As your average scrub I can say I have no idea who this is. Also Impact is seen as a normie font nowadays so you should choose something much more simple (not comic sans though, even ironic use of them has been normiefied by now).

Why would you invest. This isn’t versatile and will only muster maybe a few harder breaths out of a few people’s noses. 
Please forgive me! I’m a newb. If I didn’t post this right please remove. I read the rules but I’m still unsure. Can someone advise me if I went about this the wrong way?

No proof of concept can't invest
Hope I’m finally in early for one of those frontpage memes. I invested all I could
It's like looking into someone's spread butthole
I'm stoked about this one, I always sleep on viral investments. I got in @ birth this time
 Invented  this was definitely a format some time ago
Anime thighs and then anime tiddies and it's perfect

I'm on mobile and the gap in the cloud is grey unless the pic is clicked on then it's black. It's weird

Ol' Reliable
Is he doing that to someone's butthole?
Goatse in 3.... 2....1....
Okay but why the white text on light bg and black text on black. This isn’t rocket science.
This meme inspired me to make my own MemeCoin account.
How the fuck did you do that?
Idk how this Sub Works but im stealing this.
Invented meaning went on ifunny a month ago when it was popular?
P sure this was a format before
How is this different from the Drake one, the Bouncer, or the expanding brain one?
I like it! Im in 5000 
IPOs are risky but I have 100 $5000 calls 8/17 expiry. Let’s go to the Moon Bois

I was here when it happened. 
Nice meme. I'll take it.
Someone do goatse
PUT IT ALL ON NEPTUNE!
One has to be goatse
This better not be drakemoon 2.0
Why not just leave all the text white 
Can someone explain this meme market to me? Like wft when was this a thing.
Isn't this just the Drake meme?
This is going to be big

Das gud shit.
How do I join this sub. I wanna invest
Oh Yes.

I bet 5$
You’ve struck gold my friend
All or nothing.
This was done as a Snapchat Lense it’s pretty funny lol
BALD!!! BALD!!!
Absolutely innovative. Something outside the typical 3 frame meme. 
Now this is what I call a safe investment!
I N V E S T
Nothing will beat Tom Kenny in the shower
Dat transparencies tho 
Put me down for 80,000 vbucks
This meme was literally a snapchat filter?
Dammit! It’s like Apple all over again. I knew I should have invested early. 
I'm not a Photoshop guy but all I see on the other side is goatse.
Putting in 4 mil, guaranteed profit. 
This could had a different caption and I'm glad it has this one.
Not super versatile 
This was posted like 2 days ago
This definitely a repost
This is such a historically inaccurate meme as well since the Democratic Party started segregation, Jim Crow, and outlawed interracial marriage. 
Clarification. I didn't believe any part of this meme, also I'm not making any political statement and am not racist (I'm black)
I remember when I first used this format. Somewhat old. Might make a comeback.
I see lots of potential in this one
Thats the guy in transformers, right?
Pam's back! Pam is back! Invest now!
Oh lord get in on this ASAP. High returns guaranteed!
Old one though
Going to be a 200%er right here bois

Stop targeting me or I’m calling the police
Huh? Since when are people who make 90's kids jokes veterans? Am I missing something? Explain before you whoosh please
*gets buried alive*
Well... I don't get it, but I'm stupid, so... I'll shut up now.
Boss makes a dollar I make a dime that’s why I meme on company time. 
Moderate versatility. A safe investment, but not super high returns.

Perfect. Short sweet and simple. I’m in!
Shows serious potential
Looks like the mods of r/greentext
Every label meme is the same 
mods r not gae
A little too specific to one audience
Anything could go in the behold part, this is great. This will sell for trillions.
Invested in this fucker just to realize it was a repost of a 21kmeme
Disgusting I wish they didn't ship characters to be gay
Don't invest. I invested 500 million into this meme hours ago and it got deleted, same title as well. 
Relatable. Nice investment 
In for 5 billion. This template extends way beyond incels - it is remarkably versatile!
Reads a text from bae

***SHE DON'T WANT ME NO MORE***
What if I invest billions
Repost big Oof
OG format but is dead. Don't invest has already been used and abused months before, let this format die.
What is the name of this format? It's definitely trending.
Oh yeah, drop that love and support on ya bois!
Great meme, expect strong returns. The contrast of the violence of the original image with the positive message will ensure this meme goes straight to a couple of hundreds.
To the front page we goooo
Can we get the template for this stellar meme?

Old format but I like it and wish it would taking off so i'm investing
Relatable, easily transferrable, looks like a decent investment
Feels clunky somehow. The grammar is odd, and I don't think the comparison is emotive enough.
All in, don't let me down OP  lt;3
Decent! Not what I expected when I originally clicked lol.
I see huge potential going all in! Don't let me down OP! 
Downvote, invest, then remember to upvote guys! This one could be going places

Why are all the smaller primates little assholes?
Do you have the template without words for this?
I think I’ve seen this before
It isn’t a repost to me, OP. I’ll give ya an updoot 
The expression made me chuckle... I'll get behind it.
10/10 will invest
This one's going places.
Why deleted 
Out of memecoins to invest but have my upvote 
This really isn't a format

I made this template and posted it on this sub months ago and it lasted like a 3 days before it got stale on r/dankmemes. It was originally a post by 8-Bit Fiction on FB, I've used tons of their posts as templates over the years 
I see a lot of possibilities with this one. Not new but rarely seen before
Why would I invest in a repost?
Big buy
The feedback loop of meme investing, v0.1:

1. See post with upvotes, investments, and **multiple comments that are not replies to the MemeInvestor\_bot**.
2. Interest piqued: downvote, invest, then upvote. Remember to **add a comment that is a reply to the original post** to increase interest from other investors!
3. ???
4. Profit
Amateur investor here. Just following tips like commenting to increase interest from other investors.
My guy is always ready for the next round.
Virginscraft vs Virgin Royale
Got 15000 riding on it! Come on newb luck don't let me down!
good one! haha!
Virgin vs. Extra virgin
I don’t know American brands but I assumed Kirkland was for the most part low quality. The bottle on the bottom seems like a much better olive oil then the Kirkland brand but I wouldn’t know otherwise. 

From a foreigners perspective this meme is telling me that fortnite is the better game then Minecraft. If you had of changed or erased the actual brands and just left the extra virgin on there the meme would have worldwide appeal. 
Doesn't make sense since extra virgin olive oil is actually more expensive than regular olive oil...
Well you X posted this everywhere, so why not?
Communist memes? Definitely worthy of investment. 
Nailed this one, OP. INVEST!
If only i had more coins to invest with
Karl.. took to many pills, now he's feeling really ill, now he's on the edge of the ledge, wanting to die he looks to the sky. Depression is the only thing he thinks, if only he had links to the drugs that were in the PUG.
Already seeing returns on my earlier investment into the template. Time to turn my portfolio to WUMBO
Nothing that couldn't already be put on to the one with the two women in mcdonalds.

This is quite ironic, because this has been a bad investment.
literally me everytime I invest. My account hasn’t gone a coin over 2,000
Personally I’d love this template if it were two panel showing a blank product in the first with normal Mark Cuban in the second.
Love the confidence on that flair
Switching it up...no Homer.  I'm buying
I've lost so much on Simpson's memes! People are just not into them right now. I say don't invest, save your meme coins.

already old and pretty recently too invest minimally

i love memes in languages other than english
The question mark in the title makes me unsure of making an investment. You've got to be assertive. You've got to tell me to invest! You may have been a big shot back home in iFunnyville, but out here in the real world you're just a small fish in a giant ocean, kid. You've got to be cutthroat if you want to earn karma and meme coins. 
Low value. Sell sell sell

Its just a fucking repeat of existing memes but with a Simpson’s screenshot.

The novelty’s there, but all the jokes you can make with this format have already been exhausted.

Downvoted and would not invest.

Great use of the template
That's a dusty reference. 
I 'member
Koreaboo memes monkaS
Hell yes
Eh? Not rly funny
But....why?
Maybe sort by hot to see if someones already posted this format next time?
I just want the original picture 
This but unironically
Nooooo was gunna post this to dankmemes but got hit with the : “Unfortunately you don’t exceed the amount of karma needed to post” give me big karma so I can post
Very good meme. invest folks

Is this meme available on the Facebook marketplace? I feel it has better potential for the IPO to take place over there.
Hmmmmm.... interesting.....

I thought this meme died 
Hhhhhhh
Downvote, then invest, then upvotes. That way you maximize profits 
Not a meme, so I expect it to get taken down soon. I agree with you tho
Luigi always was a sneaky little cunt. Huntin for ghosts n shit 
Gimme that karma thot
This meme is older than pewdiepie fans
So this is just Bart smacking Homer with a chair right? 
I don't get it, why is this sub filled with dead memes that then people call  new formats  because they just missed the meme?
All these memes on here are the same format with different templates 
Step 1 - Take any picture off Google images

Step 2 - Label every signle fucking thing in the picture 

Step 3 - Act like it's a  new, inventive, versatile meme format 

Step 4 - Profit 
So this sub is officially r/labelmemes now? I think I've seen one new format this whole summer. Mods can we get a name change?
X ATTACKING Y WITH Z

NEW FRESH FORMAT BUY BUY BUY!!! 
Oh boy another label meme how original
Lazy label memes - the new economy apparently...
This is old as shit OP
I suggest people should start uploading memes they made themselves. This particular meme isn't really new. 
So sick of this shitty meta where you just put text over an image with 3 subjects
Another label meme.

First Bart+Chair+Homer

Now this. Subs dead, OP is a karma-whoring normie. GG
We know. Everyone wants to be Dynamite Hack
Every meme here is the exact same formula just on a different picture. It's unoriginal and is just getting old. 
There’s an episode of Atlanta about this
Can we start a think tank on where memes are going and what we actually need in terms of a new template that expresses something in a way that hasn’t been done before?
This shitty subreddit is a meme
Shouldn’t it be something like Gibby is labeled “Black people”, the stop sign is blank and if I can be so bold, perhaps means STOP, and Spencer is “White people making guitar covers of famous rap songs?”
Meme format aside, don't a lot of rap/hip hop songs sample rock and roll and other older hits? I don't understand this. 
Old dead meme, OP is normie
I read that as autistic guitar covers and it made a bit more sense.
I’m Asian and I like acoustic guitar covers of rap, where does that put me
I need a template for this
Gotta do the ole downvote before investing and liking after at the early stage fellas 
I actually came to the post to comment how these memes were all the same format just different templates, but I see 80% of the comments are actually saying that exact thing.
Tell that to Jonathan coulton
Y'all are fucking pulling my leg. There's no way all these submission of label memes are unironic right?
I'd like to here these songs. 
Same format as always, but new skin. I don't invest in these out of principle. 
This is hilarious because there's a cover of  no diggity  being played in the store I work at rn
Who keeps upvoting this trash
To the windows
Everyone here is discussing the merits of the meme and I am just wondering if its still OK for me to play Ignition (remix) on the guitar.
This is the new 
It would’ve been a bit more “original” if A is doing something dumb or annoying and B is hitting him to make him stop, but then again, there are many memes like that already. 
Yo paper boi (acoustic)!! 
I've been shorting 3 label memes for awhile now. It's a bubble that should have burst a long, long time ago. Please just let them die.
Doesn't even fit the template
Anyone else realize that Gibby is peak humanity
https://youtu.be/H4hGSR5njZE
Invest? Bro we did that like last year or something
Incredibly old format, I wouldn’t risk it if I were you
Relevant: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MumScDIZMJc amp;t=34s
Is this a jojo reference 
I wouldn't say this is a new format. We've had many format of people hitting other people, the only difference with this one is it's Gibby and Spencer
Not only is this a shit formula, but  White people be like  memes are deader than vine. 
Needs more jpeg
But isn’t that just post Malone though?
Fuck these shit tier memes that are random situations with words pasted over the characters. Usually high schoolers making this shit based on the  relatability. 
Is this oc?
GIBBBBBBYYYYYY
you're telling me i could take this exact image that i had on my pc and upload it for 13k karma

but i didnt
Coming in late
I like to think of those acoustic covers like the guy at the party who brings the guitar. 
*violent strumming\*
For this to be a truly investable meme, it needs to utilize the stop sign. As in, someone is forcibly stopping something else. 
And some skinny ass dude harmonizing to the song for no reason
Paper boi paper boi all about that paper boi
I wouldn’t invest.
NO! ITS NOT WORTH INVESTING! HAVE ANY OF YOU SERN ANY FORMATS ON HERE THAT GET 30K UPVOTES GET POSTED WITH NEW LABELS MORE THAN ONCE? FUCKIJG NO! STOP UPVOTING YOU SICK BASTARDS
Is it a thing that white people make shitty guittar covers of rap songs?? I have never heard about that
Fucking retard
Sign: My Hand

Guy in front: My meat

Guy hitting: Me

Damn you  guys take memes seriously 
There's a band named  Fame On Fire  that does rock covers of rap songs. I personally really like their XO Tour Llife cover and their Lucid Dreams cover.
Going in on my first investment. Seems like a solid start
Relevant: https://youtu.be/NG2EGOB9-lc
I've been saying this for years - these junk memes have no underlying value and we are headed towards a major crash in the label meme market.  

Before investing, ask yourself if the meme had an effect on you when you saw it. Would you share this yourself? Only invest in formats that satisfy these questions.
Sing for the moment is exception
Where's the one where famous rock songs or other alternatives are ripped for a  cover  in rap?
Basic usage: Add a title or caption describing one or more parties unknowingly making a bad decision. No other labels are necessary.
God that’s versatile. 
*unzips pants*
I’ve got a strong feeling about this one 
History memes always do pretty well, especially when combined with an interesting or eye-grabbing picture. Invest!
Old af. I’m out
I literally don't understand why this is still so low. Buying now for skyrocketing returns! 
i think it would have been better with  me  on ape and  my taco bell shit  on the alligator 
Doesn't have enough momentum, and not a lot of investors. Sadly, won't invest.
You're attacking taco bell shits with your asshole? 
I've put all my hard earned money on you !
This meme predates civilization itself, invest with caution.
This is fake right? Please god let it be fake.
2 part meme that has to be done, too high effort for the average shitposter

invest cautiously, don't expect much return
Can I get the template please?
Hahahahaha attention monger. It's how the world runs now. Hahahahaha 
THIS IS IT CHIEF!
Nothing is random. 
Title may hurt investment opportunities 
I'm hoping this doesn't bust I'm a new broker and I just moved to the big city to live out my dreams
How the fuck is this a format?

Is this a Ben Garrison?
That’s old af. Don’t invest.
I like this one
I didn’t know we could just pull up formats from the past 
Already seen it. Pass
Old
Seen tons of these on the front page... Days ago
couple days late there bud 
I read  smitty  as  shitty  at first
Impact lmao what is this 2011
Saw that meme in a Spanish Instagram like 6 months ago
Are we really suggesting impact font top and bottom text memes in 2018?
Impact font. Invest carefully.
One word: slader. You’re welcome.

It fucking helped me get through two years of middle school. Exercise caution, though. Their admins are strict as fuck.
When you roast a school shooter and he shoots himself 
Old meme
This is a reaction meme from a while ago. Still strong, still useful, but not as a full text meme. Don't force the nature here.
Why would 1 JUST look for 1 question. I always just google the worksheet 
I m p a c t
This is a  when you  meme with impact font. This is destined for facebook. Can this sub at least pretend its not filled with normies roleplaying the stock market?
REPOST! DONT GO NEAR THIS THING.
I am mom gay?! 
I like this one, actually. Can we hit hiroshima with a nuke?
This is exactly what it looks like for someone to be on the internet from an outside perspective. 
Replace OP with OC.
Works on multiple methods, can label girl or chair, or both or neither

Mods are gay memes are always a sound investment. BUYBUYBUY!
I wish I didn't put my money in another investment. This is the one for today!
Has this ever been done in porn before? Like they all just nut in each other?
NSFW tag, please.

Edit: thank you.
All in boys! 
What time of day is this sub most active?
Pls Mark nsfw
What the fuck! Who ever thought “oh ya know what, next art piece I do will be a circle of dudes having anal sex with each other, yes what a great idea”. 
Not gay, some guys have their socks on
Turks being turks, classic.
fuck yeah already increased by 20 upvotes
Haha. Turks
Fucking circle.
nsfw 
Hop along the guy train, mods
amp up the Big Gay

Dank NSFW meta meme.

Its funny and should increase in value quickly. But because of its meta-ness the value will stagnate after a few days.

Where can I find the original image without the text lol
Human centipede gone wrong gone sexual?

Te fuck
This is not vertasile at all and also just fits in r/dankmemes

If you invest you will loose everything! 
Circlefuck
this seems to fit only as the meme proposed, not worth investing
Inaccurate. The mods don't have nearly enough length of cock to form an unbroken circle.
How many can I get for 5 digiridoos?
NSFW tag this.
I really wonder how many guys it would take to run a circular train
Solid format, I like it. I can see this one doing well
Don't forget to upvote after investing!
Is there a sub reddit for diary of a wimpy kid memes?
ISP equals isorrowproductions
Shit, 12 tb? How did you find that much midget porn?
ISP= My sta land daddy lord
Would invest, but I can’t see any more uses for this meme. Guess I’ll pass
Isp oh isorrowproductions daddy Wachu doin
Ye why don’t people post video formats more often 
Badass
Invested all my coins gonna go to sleep and hope to see this on the front page, cheers!
Invest -800
Immutably?
I feel like the gender assumption memes has had its fair runs. Invest with caution
Memes like these cause recessions 
Legitimately thought this was r/comedycemetery for a second 
Not much potential, meme has no use except for in this setting
I say don't invest
I can see this tailing off pretty quickly 
Most potential that can be seen at this hour, in 7 millions.
Remindme! 4 hours
I poured everything into this, I expect a 25-30% return. Invest high, it won’t return anything extreme but it seems stable.
I like how all these  feminists  say things like this. If you think something is only up to men or only up to women to decide you are creating division, feminism is about equality.

This is an ethical thing, everyone has an opinion on if abortion is moral or not and then it's up to the parents to decide if they can keep the baby or not, there is a baby in the middle it's not only about the woman
Why?
Everything is a text meme these days, so I’m guessing paint.
I use PicsArt. But when I use a meme with a caption I use mematic, I put the caption, go to PicsArt, crop out the mematic watermark

Paper straws are actually so shitty after like five sips they collapse on themselves like an 80 yr old’s artery 
www.iscaliforniaonfire.com
Californian here. Incredibly accurate. There is currently smoke in the air outside. My McDonald's paper straw kind of melted inside my diet coke, but I guess I'm doing my part now. 
Topical on two fronts, this one will go places. Invest big and invest early! 
If only there was some way to drink beverages without a straw...
Every coin invested goes to save bikini bottom
Long SB memes baby. Im in. 
I will watch this meme's career with great interest 
I recommend starting a wild fire to make this more relevant again
In a weird way, I’d rather have a straw than get a lid

Nah this format was big last night already
I think I have a simple way to explain it:
If you invest at 3 upvotes you have to get to 43 upvotes to break even, but it you get to 110 or over you can earn 270% of the coins you put in.  (Going over 110 upvotes in this situation wouldn't yield more returns)
If you invest when a meme is at 500 upvotes you have to hit 775 to break even and you Max out at 1400 upvotes (only earning 123% of your initial investment)
This curve continues; the more upvotes you start with, the more you need it to gain to break even and your cap for earnings is lower.

Source: https://memes.market
Sort by new to get in early.
So you got 4 on an investment of 700. That is a super low percent, and the bot only does whole numbers so it rounded to 0.
Wanna help yourself never see zero again? Dont ride the train that already left. Get in on a meme in under a half hr if u wanna see gains
Eh, in for 250k. The returns might not be stellar but it's been a slow day so far.
Won't invest, but have my upvote.
Hot potato
I'm new here. But I like it.
Not getting an investment boner but let's see what happens 
Nice investment
It's usually around 5 GMT when memes start getting traction
Heck
Don't invest, pretty shit. Might get some short term profits from other investors if you're early, but most will get shafted.

I fucking love toon town
Political humor is usually safe. Going all in here!
We need more ToonTown memes
Holy shit a Toontown meme
Pretty meh tbh, but if you invest early it might be worth it. I’m personally in for 200k.
Isn't this the same as the Ralph Wiggum I'm in danger me meme? 
Highly reparabel and therefore profitable meme! INVEST!
Very relatable to me. 
All in boys
Not sure I can upvote a hatred of cheese.
Where’s the template
Repost of an unsuccessful meme, but I’m still going to invest big because it deserves success.
Someone put  memecoins  on the top,  me: a bad investor  on him, and then  shitty templates  on the table 
༼ つ ◕_ ◕ ༽つ GIVE TEMPLATE༼ つ ◕_ ◕ ༽つ
I wouldn’t invest. It’s a reskin of the pointing spiderman
don't forget to downvote before investing and upvote after investing it could potentially increase your income.
If the message were at the top it would make more sense.
His name is mario mario
Their last name is Mario, so Mario Mario and Luigi Mario

Don't forget to upvote after you invest!

I already invest all my coins in a shitty format... sorry guy
Bad buy. Sell! Sell! Sell!
It should have gone on, with the same meme on the tattoo again and so on. Otherwise a solid meta meme in my humble opinion. 
self-deprecating meta memes are always a solid investment 
this is the one chief

Let’s see if this bad boy can get me over a quadrillion this morning!
Label memes are so trash, every damn meme on this sub is just a random picture with every aspect labelled.
Same old format diffrent template not here for the long term
-Horny gf

DON’T FORGET TO UPVOTE AFTER INVESTING 
r/labelmemes

Why would I invest in an oversaturated meme? 
Why are there always so many labels!?
Wait when was Jason Voorhees in Scooby Doo?
You fuckers aren't even pretending to not be self aware anymore.

Is this the meme investment? Label meme investment memes?
Im sorry but when did the scooby gang encounter literal jason?!?
If you’ve been affected by issues raised in this meme, /r/sexyvelma* is here to help. 

*NSFW
Headed to the top, boyos.
God, all meme formats are the same now. They are all the same joke just with a different picture. 
Damn, two great investments available in a row
Jesus this sub sucks now. this is just r/labelmemes which clearly needs to be a lot more popular.
Or when the teacher keeps the cursor on the fucking pause button instead of pressing spacebar when they want to pause it.  Nobody wants that bar at the bottom of the screen. 
Omg this is hilarious
YouTube adds are even worse. You can deduce quite a bit based on them.
Do you have the format for this?
Parents being teachers, that really really got me ahaha
I’ll take 100 shares
Anyone wanna give me the blank? 
Buy buy buy!!! 
Lol where is this from specifially 
in turkey u cant use youtube while conected to school net
That one time it autoplayed a video of a woman streaking. This actually happened.
It really do be like that
Fr tho, why do teachers always struggle to hit  cancel  on the autoplay?
Freshman looking for their classes
I have a proposal. Let's use this format a little more creatively.
Instead of just things that are hurt by other things, let's use the format for negative effects that come about when people don't see something for what it really is. For example:

Velma: Old Grandmas

Guy in Mask: Nigerian Prince

The Bat: Fraud

Obviously that one isn't funny, but you get the idea. It could also be the man in the mask labelled as what they're supposed to be, with the bat labelled as what they really are.
.
Ok I don't quite understand how this subreddit works someone willing to explain?
This type of meme already has a billion formats, no way this will last
With all the talk of trashing label memes, I have to wonder, what memes *aren't* label memes? What template memes aren't labeled?
Jinkies. You know it’s OC when it’s made on snap chat 
Great, more label memes
https://www.neatorama.co/images/posts/634/74/74634/1407580474-1.jpg
Format here^
Wow, this is pretty accurate. Points for relatability, most likely a target for younger teens, which if we're being honest, is the majority of the people who viewed this post.
Glasses are the mouse or clicking the x to make it stop
I require format.
r/teachers might enjoy this. IDK tho my fellow educators take shit way too seriously sometimes. 
My history teacher would always leave auto captions on YouTube videos.
Ok this is the most accurate post I've seen in awhile
I hate the “Youtube” tag. Feels unnecessary imo
It's not a quick read—would not invest.
Finally, a decent meme!
When everyone watches the auto play countdown spin and we're all like  uhhh .
All in @ 356T...strap this meme to a rocket baby
Worth of investment
Not gonna buy, it's the same meme format as before  META  isnt really funny anymore.
What fetish parody video does that Tom come from
Going to invest,  Tom and Jerry memes are all the rage
Did you watermark a stolen meme?
Is that supposed to be drake lolz
Too relatable, my past experiences definitely encourage my anxiety
Relatable.... but is it TOO relatable? Risky investment, high normie takeover potential. 
Not enough obscure porn references, it has potential but cannot invest at this time
No. Please return to 2012

Lots of potential. Simple and versatile. Invest!
It's quite versatile; a solid investment. Buy
Has potential, but will grow stale quickly.
Isn’t the use case the same as scroll of truth?
I love seeing more and more original content in here. As much as there’s a million quick cash grabs, these are making solids marks in the market
Good format!
Wow, I predicted a very stable 30% and I was exactly right.
This has potential! Invest!
seems like a very copy and paste kinda thing, low effort, and above all a carbon copy of every reaction meme. (drake, tyler1 ect)
Its a fine meme
Extremely unlikely to succeed. No potential whatsoever. SELL !
Is that a stock photo? 
Perfect. Flawless format and on top of that pee pee memes always have promising results! I’m all in boys.
Looks like I have to downvote :(
I just dumped almost my entire life's savings into this new venture.  
PayPal me 30 dollars for the blanket you just ruined when I threw up after seeing disgusting excuse for a meme.
I doubt you made this but if you did, you can set the autocorrect without the dashes. Makes for a more cohesive meme.
Edgy, relatively fresh format, slow market right now.

I'm in.

*But remember* fellow investors.
DOWNVOTE.
INVEST.
UPVOTE.
Slight deviation to a great template, looks like a sound investment boys

This speaks to me, im investing all my meme coin 
Velma looks high as balls. Stay outta them Scooby snacks Velma! Bet this format would work well with the Demi lavato heroin joke.
Do it.
As a Nintendo fan and somebody who’s dad is an engineer, this is very relatable. I’m buying!
Seems promising, Daisy memes are relatively fresh
But that is the, bar none, biggest perk of being a STEM major. You get to be smug about it and look down your nose at arts majors.
Relatable and used Nintendo characters. Invest!

The baseline of this meme is pretty wide, it's just something destroying something else. There's already plenty like it, and I've already seen this meme format a while back

I’m too scared to invest, sick meme tho 
It's time has come and gone. This meme is alright, but the format is buried. Let it rest in peace
Please let this meme stay dead, for at least another few years

I saw this moving truck driving on the freeway an hour ago and knew immediately it had potential to be a meme. Found this photo on their company site to give me a start. Here's an idea.
so, this is funny and relatable, but not very versatile. How well do these tend to work here? are people buying single serving memes?

I wish I had more to invest judging by the amount of comments in here, we're going to the top.
I love the gay frogs meme because it’s sorta true except they are trans frogs now I guess lol
RIP Alex Jones
Combination of extrapolative thought and labels?? It's a licence to print gold!!
lets goooooo
This is extremely old. What’s with this sub now? All old memes being reposted as new.
So true
Thicc bubble 
Gay frogs are always in demand! Buy low, sell high!
Hey kid, wanna buy a gay bomb? 
It really do be like that sometimes 
I’d change ‘government’ to water, cause the quote is “they’re puttin’ chemicals in the water that turn the friggin frogs gay”
may potential u/Alvin19
These labeling memes are becoming so repetitive, we need a new format entirely 
They're both supposed to be the same thing. This template doesn't make sense, which means it will likely succeed.
And stagnation draws closer
I'm all in, bois! Wish me luck
Has a lot of potential, this. 
This is old boi. I don't think a revival is on the way, not worth investing.
bery versatile and fairly new
I would like to invest in this meme.

The “gay frogs” meme is overused and stale, but the format itself certainly has a lot of potential, I would say.

Not reposted one's. u/dankbob_memepants_ would be disgusted.  
Old meme, old format, *and* a repost, this is a whole new definition of not trying
Repost, OP should be banned for life for stealing other people's hard work. u/paolonoci is the creator.

This is a 2 year old format. Fuck off
Impact with a stroke gets a bad wrap but it can safely be superimposed over any image and you can still read it. 
Honestly. I ran a meme page on memcenter, got to 28th best memer on the site, then dropped it when I went to college. I still kept up with memes but god I could never run a page again. My humor is stuck in 2013.
Any classic Looney Tunes meme gets an upvote from me
25comments and 4 upvotes... pretty weird.
 Just replace the tweet and the picture  ... so delete the entire meme?

Low diversity, I wouldn’t invest. 
This is nice see so soon after. 
This one is going places
This breaks rules #1, #2, and #5

Not digging the repost but I think the unironic answer to the meme is its summer reddit season

Edit: yes, this specific image is not a repost, I was referring to the template. If you want to prove me wrong and show new versions of templates can win big, I’m not here to discourage
This Sunday I'm going to post a meme template that will bail out r/dankmemes and r/meme economy until Q1 2019.
gulp
That’s why I go /r/surrealmemes
I invested because this is probably gonna be big, but seriously this subreddit is just purely cheap label memes at this point. Random, hopefully interesting-looking images with the lines of text changing the context of the picture into a low-effort joke. Probably because it's the easiest sort of meme to pump out with little ingenuity or legwork, it just needs to be relatable and maybe clever. If I were forced at gunpoint to make a meme on the spot, something like this is what I'd make. Honestly I can't even think how I'd go about making anything other than something like this. It's easy humour. Some even make me laugh. But it's stale. These never actually catch, they're one-and-done jokes for the most part, and they're predictable. We can't devolve into this and only this, we need something else, something creative or unexpected, soon! 
All I can say is invest! Should get 350 easily.

I'd like some sort of reward for posting memes. Because when a company grows, both the owner and other shareholders get a cut of that growth. Why not do the same here?
I think earnable titles would help people be incentivized to post quality. Sort of like achievements, only certain requirements get you certain titles
It won't help the meme situation but I believe the people that posted the merchandise should also get some sort of currency if people invest
Can we just ban label memes altogether?
Random stock photos with labels on them shouldn’t be allowed unless it’s creative and understood. Everyday I see generic label memes and they aren’t bringing anything new to the table.
Investing is fun. But that's also part of the problem. People will upvote content that has a better chance for a bigger payout rather then a better  meme. 
I think there should be a subreddit specifically for memeeconomy meta memes, this subreddit is flooded with memes about investing, about popular posts etc., which means people can't really use /r/MemeEconomy to get inspiration for their own memes. I like creating memes but it has been hard lately due to meta memes and the investing bot in general.
Another rule i'd like to see added is to force posters to include a template for their meme. This would make browsing the subreddit way more efficient. 
When you are posting, 15% if your meme coins are subtracted, but you have a chance to get a return of up to 115%.

1 post per day per user
idk, I like this sub quite a bit, especially the investment system.
Label meme are the problem here, we need to innovate
While I use the meme investor bot, I think that it brings down the quality of the subreddit.


way back before the bot, discussion was much higher and it was just better imo.
1) let us short sell memes without potential allowing for an increase in volatility in the economy
2) funding rounds for memes before they can make the r/all e.g. meme must reach minimum investment from 100 users / 10k meme coin investment 
3) allow users to pick length of investment (4, 8, 12, 24 hours) longer the investment the lower the return
Sometimes I invest in a meme and, while it's still relatively successful after 4 hours, I kind of get envious to see it take-off to 20K upvotes or something later.
So I suggest, that the bot has intervals instead of it just being there for only 4 hours. You invest, 4 hours later the bot evaluates your investment and you have the option to either SELL or to keep it going. After a second 8 hours you get the same option, and a further 12 hours (that way your investment is going for as long as 24 hours, which is the approximate amount of time at which a post would die)
That way, if you supported a meme very early on, you'd get the full profit if it took-off marvelously!
I’ve seen a ton of stuff reaching r/all lately. What specifically is the mod team unhappy about? Reposts of formats is on you to moderate if that’s an issue. 

Perhaps an OC only day? Tough to enforce but might make for more new templates. 
Ban label memes? 
Guys you gotta make it mandatory that sellers post templates to the comments.  The whole purpose of this sub is to jumpstart creativity in the meme market.  The actual artists (meme makers) suffer when templates aren’t provided and thus the meme market suffers in turn.
 Ban label memes, there is r/labelmemes for that already
 us mods are dumber than the average user  so that's why you removed me as mod before posting this, you had to make that a true statement ;p 



TBH I feel as if the way to do it is through education. We need more debates over meme theory, more thought provoking things thrust upon us so that we may battle back with wit. We must remain steadfast to our ideals yet remain flexible in our reasoning. 

Stickied posts that do not get engagement won't really help it, which is why I would encourage badger to change the CSS styling of the subreddit to actually better reflect this. Make it more academic in styling, less shitposty in nature, and maybe change the sidebar sentences as well to point more users towards those posts. 

The church of old did not change until Martin Luther proclaimed his ideals and forced thought upon them, and as such we must do the same. 
More discussion of Memeology, deployment of memes, and general meme theory would greatly improve the quality of the sub *and* output more higher quality, engineered memes designed to last longer. 
Make me mod again, and invest real moneys in ~~nasdanq~~ danqex ^(frig off nasdaq)
Can you describe in more detail the way(s) in which you feel the subreddit has decreased in quality? Before thinking up redesigns or evaluating suggestions, we need to be super clear and specific about the problem we want to solve.

Edit: This is a question for the mod team as well as for the community. Let's start by figuring out how people feel about the state of the subreddit and what problems is has before eliciting suggestions. (Most of the suggestions being posted here do not include an explanation of the problem they are meant to solve.)
Everyone talks about buying new memes but no one talks about the state of current memes and whether or not they’re declining or rising or worth selling. Maybe being able to post graphs and stock prices would help 
since we can’t invest in our own posts, it would be nice if their was some sort of profit off posting memes that are successful and other users invest a lot into. 
Thank god the mods have finally noticed this
Maybe to prevent spam and bad memes, memes that don’t get X amount of investments in Y amount of time should be removed

(I’m new to this. Idk of something like this already exists)
Maybe a sell function for the meme investor but? If your Mc's are all tied up but a new hot meme has come on the market you can sell your current investment. Youd take a proportional hit but can jump on the new meme
Its been hard to recover since the 2016 Pepe Crash.  This meme recession has been rough on my portfolio.
If posting memes costed like 10% net worth but if it does well you get a sizable return, just like if you invested at 0 upvotes
I believe investors decide what passes through and what doesn't.  The need to filter content because it doesn't meet certain members predetermined standards just begs for another subreddit for them to enjoy. 
One post per template. 

 amp;nbsp;

Last time I talked to the Mods, they said that as long as it is a different text, the same template can be posted over and over again (e.g. the 'this is america' meme). Unless I am miss understanding this sub, this is where you invest in a template, or structure. But If I am wrong then disregard my idea.

This rule also affects /r/new and low karma posts
Posts should be templates (blank memes) only. If a format stands for itself, it will get upvotes. Examples of use can be in the comments.

Posting specific memes encourages just lifting from successful posts in other subs like /r/dankmemes and reposting.

Also, get rid of that damn **BUY BUY BUY!** flair. People will say that about anything because they want karma, which is slightly less worthless than memecoin.
This sub went from Reddit comic edits, to minimalist, to cartoon screenshots 
I think the creator should be rewarded
I think it'd be great to be able to pull out of the investments at will. Too often does a meme get enough upvotes in the first hour, that even if it gets another 1000 upvotes over the next 3, you barely get an increase to your return.

 It'll promote more active investment and checking of different content instead of just looking over what's points 4 hours since your last investment. 
Idea: upvote this post so I get rich
Ban half the subreddit?
So I believe Mabye have a catalog of previous memes that have gone to hot and pin it and update every so often so we can keep track of previous investments and prevent reposts
ibroke
Blow it our your ass
More moderation on and a general agreement to downvote and disregard label memes as new formats.
Innovation. More Tier 3-4 memes, more Dank the sub. We need to innovate.
Add a rewards-punishments system(ie badges and bans) to users with lots of upvoted-posts/downvoted-posts.
PS can also check for the level of repost before giving out rewards / punishments.
Hope this helps 
Delete reposts
Ban reposters
Build a wall around /r/funny make memes great again
There should probably be some form of stop gap so that when a meme gets deleted, the investments get returned. I saw a meme that was trending well the first couple minutes, and hundreds of millions were invested in it, and the user deleted it because someone else said it was a repost. 
Where’s the meme chat
Our government had forgotten that the system of private memes is the most important garuantee of quality. It is only because of the control of the memes of production is divided among many people acting independently that we as individuals decide what to upvote ourselves.


Do something against low effort label memes. They’re everywhere and although they’re funny sometimes, they’re just low effort.
Im kinda new here but I wonder; if you make a considerable investment in a post and it gets deleted do you receive a refund? 
If not my suggestion would be refunds cuz I get paranoid about investing lest that be the case. 
Make pinned posts on meme debates and discussions, since you know, and we all know that any post that is related to the economy but isn't a meme itself isn't going to make it out of new. 
This would make conversations on meme templates, what's going to be the trend, how the economy is going, potentially allow the trading of meme templates, and on the rare occasions people make some groups of traders, like ye olde Dank of America and Goldmeme Sachs
Strongly discourage label memes. Those things are a plague to this sub, yet I understand how some people may feel if we banned them all together.
Just ban all label memes. Force people to be creative or dig deeper for new memes.
The top trending thread is a same-day repost and the mods do nothing about it.  So there's that.
 gt;implying this sub was ever great
I hope the owner/OP of the meme get's like MemeCoins if the meme takes off. Because that's how business works
Have themed weeks
There should be a 10% sale fee that is given to the creators
Label memes posted only on Sundays.
Can you make it possible to short the meme stocks? 

Bet against the meme, make some money from the downfall of others...
Meme quality has been trending down over the past year or so but the investment bot has drastically accelerated the downturn imo. People posting or reposting shit templates and others upvoting them to boost their “investments.”

I think the bot and the investment system need to go and this sub has to return to its roots. This used to be a place for great new templates and actual meta discussion of the meme economy but now it’s been dumbed down and gamified with this stupid investment bot. This place is going to remain a cesspool until it’s gone.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yo
I think there should be a second subreddit created called  MemeMarket  where memes are posted and invested in. 
Keep this sub for posting  templates for the meme market, as this was what the sub was initially for. 
You should allow more new users. I don't have time to watch and refresh reddit all day to comment and get karma. By the time I see something it has gold and 50k upvotes.

Loosen regulations, bring in more memeprenteneurs.
Ban  blank template  content. 80% of content are blank memes. 
Ban label memes
THANK YOU. I’ve been dying to bring this up. /r/MemeEconomy is basically becoming a copy of /r/labelmemes where you put “BUY BUY BUY” in the title. We need to get to the original format of meta-analysis and metrology that made this economy so great.
Yo I'm new here. Can anyone explain how this work?
Let newbies post memes dammit 
Better would be like double the coins if we do it on certain meme format and that changes daily or something
#BringBackRageComics
I'd say something along the lines of it costing a certain amount of memecoins to make a post, a flat fee, say 100,000 plus a percentage of their total coins, like 10%. That way the flat fee keeps new people from posting and the percentage is for people with tons of coins (since the flat fee wouldn't matter to them).

Everyone gets a flair counter next to their name, and when the person gets a certain amount of upvotes in a certain amount of time the post is added to their counter. 

Not sure if this is possible though.
There could be an approval system akin to how r/surrealmemes functions. Only particular people who have proven to post quality memes can post them. Anyone else can invest and enjoy that function of it, though. At least I personally feel that’s fair.
Old format. But it never really took off, so it might turn a profit.
I will watch your career with great interest.

New teachers were the students who could use the new projector and DVD players, that their teachers couldn't. 

New students don't understand how these ancient tech works. Yet schools can not upgrade. 

Old teachers somehow still don't know how to use the old tech or new tech.

Solid initial pickup, relatable and picking up quick steam. I put about 70% of my balance in this bad boy and expect \~40% returns at minimum.
Do you even know what the word template means?
I've invested this month's rent money in this. If it fails I'm on the streets. 
This meme is older than my grandma smh
It’s not really a meme format though
This has been going around fb for a while now..
how do we know the skelly isnt putting himself in? 
Pretty shit
Blew it with  minnies 
Five  minnies 
This is a decent meme but there’s zero versatility
this meme is killing me
I’d go in if it wasn’t 1:23 in the morning and an hour late. I’ll upvote though 
A new pic for this meme, can see versatility by changing out the text. Solid invest. 
How do I invest? More importantly what do I invest (currency)? Noob here
*minnies*
I predict  minnies  will become a thing now. How do I invest in that? 
“Wake me up when September ends”

*me on October 1st*
“Don’t vaccinate”

“You’re an idiot you should-“

“**Don’t vaccinate**”

“Omg how could you be so-“

“**DON’T VACCINATE**”
My life in a meme
 Minnies ?
I went in with 2500 I'm trusting you man

Seems like the community likes it!

Make sure to Upvote AFTER you invest so that the karma counts in your favor. 

May all your profits come back huge!
Lazy town nostalgia mixed with contemporary subjects.  Love it!
Make this about investing, rule #1
Kind of a Facebook meme vibe tbh
Too many label memes have flooded the markets. I dont think this is the future
RRRRREEEEEE
This one is old and the original was fucking hilarious tho.
I see value, new take on a despair template 
This meme is ancient, I don't think its worth investing in
imagine all the new labels you could put
it's a kids show btw and so far 3 hosts have died as martyrs
I’m not sure about it. I need second opinions
tbh a very risky investment
Ah so youve seen the wild fortnite player
A lot of potential tbh.
Meme template https://imgur.com/gallery/p5yEMvu
It's got some years on it, but with today's thriving simple label formats it could sell easily
Gulag  gt; All
Stop with the text over pics meme template. It’s the same thing every damn one 
This one is pretty strict, very few uses
Shhhh....don’t make a sound.
What’s the market it’s trying to cover?
Here is the template: https://imgur.com/a/oCByd23

This is just recycling same format with different pictures. 
EXAMPLE: https://imgur.com/gallery/2JnUqxJ
Too old fam, this format was used wayyy back in the Impact font days. Only safe for meta, postironic, or deepfried memes.
I like this, its has the barest minimum barrier to entry, while.still being easily made. Allows for growth without over saturation 
I made something similar a week ago or so.

Remember to downvote before investing, and upvote after! 
Why must you repost 
*make a subreddit dedicated to internet memes*
”Why aren’t memes funny and original anymore? ;((”
Facts
Damn this hits hard
Are format of memes is archaic we must invest in crypto, cryptographic that is, lest we fall prey to the old markets failure. You can find a huge source of these from r/surrealmemes, r/deepfriedmemes, or r/okbuddyretard . The memes are so fucking cryptographic and meta and ironic that they provide the explosive mental stimulus that old memes used to before we became accustomed.
U ok?

It’s not that versatile to be honest

It’s pretty much the same outcome every time, and while you *can* say the same for most memes, this one is not that easy to diversify or even make more panels since I doubt there’s someone out there who can replicate the same art style or photoshop that well

Guys this whole subreddit is fucking stupid, it was nothing but self defeating in the first place
SO VERSITLE BUY BUY BUY
I like the way I can't tell if this sub is more r/meme or r/wallstreetbets

this one is actually very versatile. you can replace dark humor with all kinds of weird kinks or guilty pleasures. go big on this one.
It's nothing too new or original but it's a very versatile template
How versatile is it though. Isn't it just another hard pill to swallow?

I guess it's a bit different like a kind of shocking advice kinda thing but it's still pretty similar.
Great future!!
I guess people investing on you post says it all...
Text post meme, high risk high reward
A pictureless meme! Invest in this to diversify your holdings.
Remember when people would post about how memes are doing in the economy, instead of suggesting memes?
Is this a meme?
!invest 
Fuck it throwing in 800k
let's go boisss
I think making the priority an investment portfolio as opposed to enjoying the memes is the issue. Increased sharing of memes increases the frequency we see memes, therefore increasing the rate at which we see repeats. The same goes for making low quality memes, the more acceptable a low quality meme is the worse off we all are. The comparison of memeeconomy to crack tells me most users are here as part of a trend and this subreddit's popularity is unsustainable and will have detrimental effects to the memer community of reddit.
If the mods would just delete posts that don't follow the rules, then this wouldn't be happening.
Straight to the top with this one. Make OP’s nightmares come true
I’m not investing in this! It’s not even a meme!

this looks really normie. 

can i short a meme?
Nice to see someone pushing a type of meme rather than a  versatile template  which have saturated the market. Content based investments are the financial model of the future. 
How does this belong here?

I was confused as to why I kept seeing this in my suggesteds. Seems other people have had similar experiences. Pretty gay, I guess.

The Life of Pablo is an underrated masterpiece.
Doesnt sit well with Ye stans, if you want to tap into the wavy sector of the market have the second image be (J Cole/Drake/Taylor Swift)'s discography

That's more like Ye tbh
Repost!

I feel like we need a subreddit for talking about the memeeconomy, because I see some posts like this. They technically do not follow the rules but it would be nice to discuss stuff like this
Is this a new format?!?
I've seen glue made from horses less dead than this format
Is this an old, overused meme that at one point over saturated the market?
Risky
Don’t invest
OP took one for the team
Passing on this one.  I get the joke, but it's too blatant, too simple, too bland and ultimately nothing new here. 

Maybe if you have whited-out  Instagram  and put  r/MemeEconomy , there could have been a chance.
DO NOT INVEST! REPOST!
Tentative investment but I’m hopeful 
Fuck, you're basically forcing me to invest

Format could have another level by labeling the croc head mask thing
not bad i guess
I don’t 100% agree, but this hilarious and timely.
This is the type of shit I can get behind. 
By making a label meme, you're contributing to the problem.

Only thing against it, is the timing. IPO few posts down with same joke is gaining traction
Ironic, relevant, I don’t see why not to invest in this.

This is a bad format when you consider context. The man on the right ends up killing everyone in the church with style.

Label memes are really basic but effective, i would invest, but i'm more respectable than that.
I don’t think this one will catch on
I can see this meme becoming popular when combined with the  still beat  meme
stock up boys. this one is going places.
So basically the guy looking out of blinds template but on a different image?
This sub is becoming shit. 
Zero versatility
Did you find this on 9gag in 2013?
I don’t see how this is versatile at all. 
Its missing a little something. It doesn't quite bridge well, particularly with the seemingly pointless white space. (Lord I hate the 10m posting delay.)

uh... what? 
As much of a connoisseur of weeb garbage as I am myself, I don’t see the potential here
i’m all about manga shots for meme templates but yeah not much potential with this one. 
Could be better if the detour was longer or lead to the ocean or something.
I like how the minority is doing the heavy lifting gives this format great potential which is why I've made it my first investment.
There was an attempt 
Ironically this is a repost. You're a douche dude.
Triple repost...
Invest !
Blank template please 
enough with labeling memes

The meme recession grows more every day... We need to downvote label memes, it is the only cure. This work motivate meme-makers to work harder.

Got in early. Hoping to ride this to a new meme tax bracket. 
This is a funny, relatable meme. But that's not what this sub is for, right? It's not r/dankmemes. If we're judging it simply by its template, and the potential of this specific template, well then I think it's sort of weak. But no doubt this'll blow up anyway, simply because people are thinking like Redditors and not like investors. 
I hope I didn’t invest too late to catch the wave on this one
I'm stuck watching this explode while all my memecoins are still tied up in another investment

EDIT: ITS ON BOYS
Don't forget to downvote, invest then upvote for P R O F I T

This format is super stale this point. Pictures with labels are getting annoying to a lot of people. I have observed recently a positive trend on the growth of images with a single caption where the image is the meme, the words merely the context

How would one use this?
Did someone literally invest in this PSA
Dude this sub is literally named Meme Economy 
Agreed. I actually think the whole  economy  part is pretty neat, but it's brought down the quality of this sub greatly. I'd love to see a balance, but I don't really know how it could be achieved. 
inb4 this is the night's biggest investment opportunity 
I believe in your message OP, I am the initial investor- in 100k
In the TLDR, the complaint boils down to  the sub feels like a game...   but that's exactly the point, this sub IS a game.  While reposts and low quality content can be a drag, the complaint here is that a game feels too much like a game.
It do be like that sometimes 
I agree this sub has become more cancerous over time.
In some ways it's beautiful, as we've all created a perfect model of an economic bubble. We all believe in the meme coins and we've slightly subverted the sub so that we're all making more and more meme coins with slight variations on the same tired jokes and little truly fresh investments.

IMO we've been entering a bear market since car salesman was normiefied and currently a lot of investors are shorting cartoon label memes. The outlook is not looking great.
I don’t see this gaining many upvotes.
How would this be used in other scenarios?
I see the potential OP. I like where your heads at. 
I’ll invest a few co-pays. 
Definitely worth an investment. Any meme templates that start with a depression joke attract more attention.
Maybe feminism

Label memes are very uninteresting at the moment. There is no such  new  label meme that will move the market now, we need a new template that isn't so easy to use and to normify. Only then memes will rise to excellency

Decent amount of short term potential, though its long-term prospects are limited I think. Buy now, sell once it hits the first peak and begins to dip.

I would hope just putting  10 year olds  should imply theyre virgins
wait what kind of 10 year old isnt a virgin?
I mean, 10 year olds probably should be virgins...
Of course the virgins they’re 10 
Just pawned my great grandmothers antique lamp to invest, let’s gooooooo

Why is the virgin part needed, isn't it a given?

How are ninja memes still running 
is there a fucking non virgins 10 years old?
Now this... This has potential to be great.  I see numerous conspiracy memes coming out of this one.
Was here at 0 upvotes wondering why it didn’t say I invest my coins, found out I fucking put it in the normal comments. Feelsbadman..
This is it! This is the meme that will give me my millionth memecoin!
sorry, I am 10 but not a virgin so this doesn't offend me 
Downvote, invest, upvote!
#anyone else invest then quickly downvote before the bot responds?
The ceiling is high with this one. Invest EVERYTHING
I don't know about you but lost 10 year olds haven't even hit puberty
Do we want the 10 year olds not to be virgins
 gt;implying that kids lose thier virginitys at or before 10
Not a fan 
Nononono, the 10 year olds go to Ali-A, not ninja. 
Hate when the 10 year olds have been assaulted by their uncle's 
I was having sex daily by 10 years old, kids these days 
Should've Made it so the hand that's controlling the puppet is epic games ir somehing
Well obviously the 10 year old are virgins they can’t have sex until 16.
Do you really have to specify the 10 year olds are virgins? It would be concerning if they weren't.
For the love of god downvote this
When u “create” a template

perhaps it is time to revive this old gem?

I hope links to other subreddits work!
oi dickhead, i made this template an uploaded it yesterday, all you've done it add a caption and a shitty watermark in the bottom. get reported cunt
smoobypost is a pretty popular subreddit and they create some great content. The only problem I see with this post is the jpeg, if it was higher quality I could see it being a secure investment.
Temporary window here, but there have been enough complaints about label memes lately that this could possibly get some traction. I'll bite. 
this is a standard meme :v
Fuck it, I’m a sucker for Yugioh memes, going in cautiously
I advise to stay away from this one.
A lot of animosity going around for label memes right now combined with the irony of this meme being a label meme and a dash of gruesome humor that Reddit is known for means this meme will be a success.  Invest while it's cheap and reap big rewards!
Don't take the caption to heart, fellas. 
Invest, then UPvote. 
Nevermind downvoting; it doesn't really make a difference. It does, however, hinders the post from rising. 
Wtf... why is everyone at 0 upvotes? Is this rigged?
average of 3 upvotes per minute? not bad.
Every time I read one of these kind of titles I read it in the voice of a ferengi from star trek 
ITT: Every single person downvotes then upvotes, effectively doing nothing.
How does one invest in a meme?
May I point out that downvoting and then forgetting to upvote is actually better than not doing anything?

Oh so we’re into object labeling again now?
As usual same templet different picture
As bayraklari
If only I could tell the people during the time of rage comics that future memes will just be words written on top of random pictures that convey similar ideas, requiring absolutely no work at all.
What does this template offer that the other 400 label memes don’t? 



This sub is so boring.
Everyone, pro tip. Don't order it minus onions, order it with Only all of the other ingredients. They are less likely to mess it up. For instance:

McDouble only ketchup mustard and pickles. 

Except you shouldn't get pickles cause they are gross. Onions are fine.
r/onionhate
Allright but hear me out, a Big Mac has onions in the sauce, so even if you order it with no onions you get onions. *And* pickles. My point, dont bother ordering a Big Mac with no onions without asking for no sauce. 
Im allergic to onions and i hate when i order my hamburgers without onions but they still put onions on the burger
I'll never mature into enjoying onions. Invest!
An interestingly different post, I like it, get those damn onions out of here
McDonald's employee here, those unions seem to get everywhere and we have no idea why, pls send help
Can't we just ban these reskinned label memes as contraband?
There’s always 1 speck of onion and it’s somehow on my very last bite. It’s been fucking with me psychologically for years. 
If it has a grill receipt on it, it's totally on the table. If it doesn't, it's more likely the person who took your order built it together incorrectly or didn't put in no onions properly.

It's hard to break muscle memory. 
Abort! It was already on iFunny, sad to see a meme die so young
These memes are gonna cause the great memecession
*McDonalds Employe slaps bun of Burger* - This bad boy can fit so much Onions in it.
Why y'all hate onions so much? They are on of the greatest vegetables out there.
I work at maccas and someone yelled at me for giving them three Pickles instead of 2
Onions do not belong on the following:

* Burgers
* Pizza
* Sausages (debatable)
* Kebabs

Thank you for hearing my opinion and please do not hurt me.
To be fair, if you don't like onions your opinion doesn't matter.
Wait since when can you ask for specific things at mcdo ?
This is why I've started going inside and using the machine

the machine never fucks your order up

and you can get bacon on your big mac
What is the source of the picture
Just an FYI, it's because the onions get stuck to the pickles in the container on the prep line. So they don't willingly put onions on, it's just cross contamination.
This dude looks like my boss. Anyone have a blank template so I can send it to him?
They can't even make them big and round like Wendy's. Gotta force me to get a napkin to scrape them off my burger and pick some of them out of the goddamn meat.

this isn't a new meme format. this is just changing pictures in the background at this point.
Honestly tho, what type of animal doesn’t like onions?
Why on earth would this be a buy
Looks like a budget Saddam Hussein. 
This format is getting old
This sub is on the way down 
Why does everyone put  buy now  or  buy buy buy  I mean this is a funny meme but it doesmt make sense 
I think i just had a stroke. I red  no homos  instead of  no onions . Help me, deep fried memes have made me rotten on the inside.
I like it, but way too many meme formats these days are just random images with text over them. Something else with more visible effort put into it would really shine through I think.
I placed an order for a Quarter Pounder with no pickles once (I only eat my pickles cold) and got a burger with only the patty and lots of pickles. Only realised when I got home. 
Only the worst kind of people custom order at McDonald's drive thru. Any SUV or Dodge Caravan filled with fat people and a woman driver you should just put it in park and read a book by Tolkein.

Pick your value meal or number and go. 

Low value. Would have worked better if the target was a lower branch. McDonalds has surprisingly only messed up my no-onion big Mac once or twice. Choosing a regional chain is more likely to enrage and amuse
Only reason I ask for no onions is because they  use that shreaded junk that tastes bad and makes me gag when they just hang around my mouth. Then there is the fact they always coat the inside of my burger in a layer as thick as two cheese slices.
Am I the only one that loves onion, can take or leave pickles, but hates mustard and never remembers which places add it by default? 
I play my trap card: nightmare onion cage!
Pizza places are the worst offenders here. 
This is every meme on this sub now 
Are there any rules about posting memes you have invested in to normie subs?
This meme is a great example of why we will see a crash. It's just a subprime meme wrapped in the golden foil of another subprime meme. The tower we built on investing in these subprime memes will collapse, that is inevitable.
Me but with pickles, they even once put mayo on my burger that doesn’t even have mayo on it in the first place.
Just a shitty label meme with no long term potential.
Just saw this on Instagram. It's already tanking in value. SELL IMMEDIATELY!!!
I love unions

It's been a while since I've seen a fallout meme, this is a reliable investment.
Too niche, do not buy. 
Fun fact: sleep cycles of the body last around 3 hours so it’s more difficult to wake up after 8 hours than it is 6 or 9, because waking up after 8 hours will be waking up during a cycle.
Shit meme
Do they still delete posts because of  not investment related titles? 
I lost 3 kidneys when I invested in this one

Don't buy! Don't buy!
Good potential 
Is this an EU meme? In Montana at least, an A- is 94, but I hear that most other places just do a letter every 10%.  I may just be dumb though.

Just another reminder I created this template 115 days ago.

Idk if ur the first to post it here but its a pretty old format
Sounds like it might not be new, but if it's new enough to some people, it may get a little traction.

Also, meme technology has increased greatly in the past several years. Maybe some fresh takes on this could give it some life? 
Template with better quality?
low quality, reminiscent of memes from r/comedycemetery. Jazz it up a bit and its decent

Hate to be the annoying science prick but respiration is nothing like breathing and doesn’t require the lungs. It’s a process that happens on a cellular level where glucose and oxygen are converted into carbon dioxide and water lol
Sry dawg, but that's a repost
This fits Toby.

Man I wish I could invest in my own post
How do I do this, I’m lost.

This isn’t versatile at all.

Sorry Xbox is definitely better lol downvoted
Nah, what’s a console peasant doing on reddit? Go back to Instagram or Facebook. (See what I did there with an up and coming investment?)
This is so old, can we hit 50 children
I don't like this meme specifically, but I love this format.  It has so many uses. 
very old too
This better take off
Fuck it, in for 10m.

Ah yes, another 3 label meme. We need more please. /s
Can we stop using “Versatile” to describe every meme, how many scenario’s involve erect uncles? 
Not a new format. 3-label is stale.
#DoWNvOTe,    InVeSt,   then UpVoTE!
Jfc memes are garbage nowadays. Can we think of anything better than label memes?
Can someone get OP a dictionary? Show him the word  Versatile  because this isn't it.

Simple format, very versatile. A lot of potential here. I Invested immediately and suggest others do as well. 
Easy to use.  Remove the protective tab... 
I see potential in this format 
but can't justify buying, please don't make me regret this 
Someone needs to put Splatoon porn on the screen... It'd work, so damn well.
I never knew something could be reposted so many times in such a small amount of time.
\#Relatable
I uploaded a template I made on my phone but the original I found said “asking mom to stay up to play games” and “when I’m dropping in fortnite”. 
It's not a label meme hooray 
# Upvote after investing 
Invest now !!
I dont have anymore coins

Shieeeeet
Already been reposted so must be hot!
Y u delete
16 upvotes in 3 minutes... looks promising!

Just made my biggest investment by far, Almost all in. Hope this is a successful investment
This is gonna be big the growth is exponential. INVEST EVERYTHING you have in this meme!!!!
Looks promising, yet so did my last investment and I lost 40%
u/dankbob_memepants_ get in if you got coin. 
Hey buddy, just put all of my memecoins into this. If it fails you’re getting a visit pal.

Another option is to post as-is with lead-in text, such as

 Teacher explaining video game design with examples from the 80s  When you ask for an appraisal on /r/MemeEconomy  

etc.  


Or just post as-is in reply to someone else giving advice / providing an opinion.  Guaranteed\* to trigger.  


\*( Guaranteed  in this case is a branding term not to be confused with an actual guarantee)
This is my photo that someone pulled from my Instagram (@sweetpjess) without giving me credit. Thanks for posting it, maybe next time just say where you got it! 
Promising format, looking forward to examples
Didn’t I just see this lmao
Someone already posted this.
Repost-kinda
Shouldve been- Me- That Gay shit- Fortnite
This meme has great potential
Stop lol
Did you really have to post twice 
…it’s fucking weird. 


And I like weird. 
Happy cake day!!
This one's a bit of a stretch... Not very well suited to the  label  format.
Ehh it’s kinda old
Very versatile invest now before you regret it
I misread 'invest' as 'incest' for second there.
I see huge potential in this meme
This type of ironic upvote memes have been around for the past year. Would not invest
Don't invest not promising 
Don’t really see any viable context. Would not invest.
Should be Nord VPN.

*THIS MEME IS SPONSORED BY NORD VPN*
I see huge potential with this! 
But isn't this just the soldier protecting the sleeping citizen but reformated?
I can’t tell if this is ironic or unironic
*Chinese goverment
This was a great fucking investment. Very pleased.
This meme will definitely bring in big profits
huge surge in memecoins will occur with an investment in this meme
Lots of potential, I'm in
My girlfriend choked on this meme 
You failed me Rebel 
Horrible. Need I say more? I’m sorry but this ain’t it Chief.
No variation available. What is this meme?
Very risky but it might work
Template pls op
We'll make history
Remember to downvote, invest and upvote!
I will not let the sub stoop this low 
we might be looking at the next wolf of kek street ladies and gents
Don’t really see anime memes going mainstream. I’m withholding my meme coins for now
This is the same as that other politician meme- or whatever you kids call it.
Did you post this some where Else or steal it? Because I’ve seen this before.
No! We must go deeper
Aint that the trewth
This one's been done a bunch of times.
Someone already posted this, post it in /r/dankmemes instead
Don’t really see this going anywhere. That’s a not from me, dog.
This is gold.  
**REMEMBER TO DOWNVOTE BEFORE INVESTING AND UPVOTE AFTER FOR MAXIMUM PROFIT**
I can really only see this reaction image popping up on Facebook. Would not invest
Got a good feeling about this one boys! 
Ultra normie, high risk low reward invest. Played out joke
Upvoted just for the people who invested :)
45 upvotes... lot of investments... gettin pretty popular. I think you know what you need to do now.
Christ almighty. Is the new strategy reposting the same meme 20 times in a day and hoping that it catches on? Must have missed the memo.. 
Would really only go with ironic memes like r/BoneHurtingJuice ir r/DeepFriedMemes. Wouldn’t invest 
Mods are gay. 
I will upvote, but I won’t invest. I laughed but I feel I am more retarded than most.
Ancient meme. Do. Not. Invest. 
I’ve seen this about 4 times today already 
he changes from white to black apparently 
I like how your username is his second auto search term lol
Versatile enough; would invest if I hadn't gone all in. 
Fuck it! I’m going in!
No coins, but I can tell this can create some nice profits if you’re early

Original format, fresh content, makes sense. Solid invest!!!
Meme older than my grandma

Old ass format don’t invest
Invest here.. and thoughts? I think the template has potential?
Wait my age changes with time am I age fluid? 
Time for a fucking crusade
Fuck me, that image looks like an awareness poster about online grooming. 
...No
Question to these meme veterans, if you happen to lose all of your meme coins, is there anyway to earn some back? I'm too nervous to invest because i don't wanna lose them all lol 
10 upvotes in 15 views.  Posted late at night but might have a chance here folks
Finally a worthy investment in this stagnant market!
Üfff Reis bee
Thoughts?
Some of have been trying to diversify. It's hard to find success out here though.
This has been one of dozens of posts pointing this out.  If you have an issue with it, make more creative Memes and share them with the community, don't just make an observation 
Label memes are still in
I see you’re really dedicated to changing the sub
You literally linked another reddit post. Reposting is becoming godly.
Winter
It's already on the front page
Labeling images stale meme over an even more stale topic

DO NOT INVEST
So under rated
I actually kinda like this one.
Probably won’t get enough traction but i upvoted because it’s a really solid post
What is it?
4 hours on the gilded pokemon post just ended.  Next storm will rise here!
Oh but that second frame 
Lmao does anyone on this subreddit ever sleep?
Shoulda gone all in when i had the chance
**Invest!**
Front page 
Fantastic opportunity

Remove the two middle panels, then we can talk.
I’m doing the thing right now. Gnight reddit, sleep tight MemeCoins, don’t let the bad returns bite. 
I feel obligated to invest because this is every day
Yeah, this is the post that broke the camel's back. blocking this sub.
Shouldve gone all in when I had the chance
I'm all in for 320. Looking forward to my new balance of 5 memecoins in 4 hours. 
Investing $0 for 15 upvotes? Sounds amazing to me
It's a label meme, but it's not a usual labelling. I'll invest a bit, I suppose.
Seems like a good one! Invest 
Going all in. God save me 
When it’s a repost but as a scientist 
A Fortnite meme but it’s something original and funny and not the recycled “Virgin/Garbage” joke? I’m putting my money into this one!
Would be way funnier if it was the IRL twitch thots who essentially use the platform as a cam girl site
How do I buy
High Rolling at 1,000 meme bucks, WCGW

Label memes about label memes in the meme economy posted on the meme economy. I'll pass.
Remember to downvote before and upvote after investing to maximize profits lads 
This is VERY versatile! INVEST! Hurry!
Hey newbie here, how the fuck do i sell ? and how the fuck do i keep my shares if i want to 
I feel like Sheen would actually say that though
This is a format. Template would be blank so people can fill their own version in. 
Are you fucking kidding me?
I love this idea. I think the timing is unfortunately in a meme bear market (night hours US, no one wasting time at work on Saturday). Will follow this for future investment opportunities.

Epic meme!

I am a people person.
If you have skills that are real and relevant, then they aren't things you would hide.
This is in no way a new format, just a variation of the same old meme.

HOW MANY TIMES WILL THIS BE REPOSTED ON THIS SUB!
Sooo old. Bad investment.
Not versatile, seems lazy, do not invest.

Everyday, I can feel the meme economy going lower and lower

Oh yeah it’s shit btw, no hard feelings
Low versatility 
Downvote, invest, upvote, ?? , profit!
Quality shit. Went all in.
Almost all in, hope this does well
Ehhhh I mean maybe? It just needs to be very well made. I wouldn’t recommend investing a lot. Wouldn’t be surprised if it explodes or hits the ground hard. Be careful, folks

Lol, you implying that we around here aren't normies? 
I mean, I sure hope the 10 year olds I play games with are virgins. 
I actually really like minecraft... :(
Downvoted for insulting the holy craft....

I'm in. Let's get to the front page!
Why do r*dditors insist that they are not the  normies  despite the fact Reddit is one of the most popular websites/apps atm?
Are we assuming reddit users aren’t virgins?
I'm an old man, but I think it's bad for people to label virgins as something negative. Let kids be kids, and don't make them think something is wrong because they haven't porked yet.
I’m not investing since you put minecraft up there.
niggabyte 
I love making fun of myself
A little inaccurate, minecraft attracts females/males of every nearby species 
Invest 3 mil at 4 upvotes, profits are coming in now!
Except minecraft
This hasn't peaked yet.
Don’t invest! This insults minecraft, universally accepted as the best game on earth!
They forgot Reddit
Invest early to get maximum profits!
Riding all the way to the top fellas
Minecraft is only for real men not virgins 
Mostly kids play those games and you’d expect kids to be vergins 
Minecraft is only for big pp men you cuck 
Minecraft is a man's game 
Makes fun of virgins

Uses term “normies”


Repost from 10 hours ago
Insert label meme of spiderman  dankmemes  pointing at spiderman  virgins 
Aren't incels are a current hit thing instead of virgins? What's the difference btw?
This is false. I haven't used any of these and I'm still a virgin.
This is a bad meme 
Why the fuck is Minecraft their people who play it get more pussy then fortnite players
You can definitely tell the average age of users on this sub from this thread. About 16-18 years old. Hate new Fortnite, love Minecraft because they played it when they were 10-12 years old. 
Ohhh, original. Not like other memes where they just put text like:  me  *beating*  my meat at 2 am . 
Plain template anyone??
Where's the versatility? How will you be able to make more than 3 memes in this format?
tbh ever since the cringy 10 year olds moved to fortnite, Minecraft hasn't been that funny to make fun of. I wouldn't invest in calling Minecraft players virgins.

Wait, are you kidding? You didn't even try to hide the fact that this is a repost. You literally x-posted from another sub. This is not the point of this sub!!
I like the meme. But there isnt a new template or joke here
This isn't a subreddit for memes you found on instagram
Downvoted by OP for maximum potential.  Will upvote later.
!remindme 25 minutes
This going to be the big thing guys
Idk how to feel about this
Switching the Reddit and Repost pieces would be better. In its current state, OC is still compatible with Reddit.
Been there
in retrospect, this might have been better had you intentionally added a typo in your title 
Decent template but not the best use
Repost but I think it has potential to get a small profit 
Great, topical meme, even if it is overused a little.  Sound investment for a decent return boys! 
Poor investment to whoever has
What if you nut and shit at the same time? Riddle me that, Tyson. 
u took this from r/boottoobig tho

The market has been flooding with them, it is peaking now but I predict a crash soon 
I think the Neptune format was the reason
Boi this isn’t r/me_irl
I'm not crazy about this format personally, but I like your general message here. Lots of complaints about label meme saturation, but not a lot of investments in new formats.. 
Litterally a label meme, so meta but still risky
I've seen some of this template, but it's really hard to interest anyone (can't find it funny). I'd rather support unsuccessful investors with an upvote.
Is 
Yes but how does it work
Let's bring back Earth-Chan
Cursed Image memes are hot. BUY IN

I'm just commenting so I get karma too
Biggest investment yet. Don't fail me now OP!
Meta memes being the meta brings in some serious profits
Going all in on this. Get your investments quick!
All my life savings on this one. Don't let me down.
I don't know why my investments are being unsuccessful, can somebody explain what I'm doing wrong here?
I N C E P T I O N ! 
AND IT'S A LABEL MEME
it's a bubble
Damn I just investes everything I had into a shit format compared to this
Even self-aware meta memes are becoming stale.
Is this what inflation looks like
Tough choice, if first money in goes big I guess I'll go in big as well :\^/
No, this is terrible. Do not invest.

I would classify this as a Deep Fried Meme
Family Guy acid trip.
Double meta is always a win.
Very manipulative format. I can mainly see this with meta posts, politics, or controversial subjects in general. We al know how much Reddit loves controversial subjects, even if you feed into the circle jerk. I would 100% invest, fellow memers
Who the fuck invest in this?! Was a meme 6 months ago
!opensesamy
This isn't a new format
This is the fifth time I've seen this
Repost. Do not invest. 
Has great potential, all in
Yd you block out the middle
How the fuck can this be used in any way?
Well ya can't anyways, so
Ffs this was popular like a month ago 
Funny, versatile, and as far as I can see new. Invest!
This is the first meme I've seen on here in a while that can truly be called  versatile , invested half of what I own. Be cautious for normification though.
There is always a bigger hole. 
I wish. My friends are also antisocial af
PSA: Dont forget to upvote , invest then
down vote for higher meme versitility
Don't let me down mf. I'm nearly broke.

Thanks for labeling the pit sweat, I wouldn’t have spotted it w/o that
Pit sweat label made chuckle. Take my money
Invested for the pit sweat
This was like, 3 months ago?
I would have invested if the meme was uploaded correctly most people just scroll past them and don’t click

Old meme, sorry bud. Seen in many Mormon subreddits, including r/memes 
Jesus this format is flooded
Ah man I made this! Can I invest in my own meme?
Highly versatile, invested 20 Billion. 
Can’t wait to see what becomes of this one aha
I just saw this on r/bikinibottomtwitter and was gonna post here. Beat me to it
Refreshing to see a template
I like it! Very versatile!
Insane potential. This month's best investment. To the front page!
This is a good one to invest in! 
INVEST! Remember downvote invest upvote people! 
Two panel memes are a safe investment. Safe bet for first 100 meme coins
Extremely versatile. Many many many great uses. 
Nice template, just not investing because people in this sub only upvote memes nowadays 
This needs more upvotes
It would tale long for meme creators to crop the heads out.
This shit is perfect, thank you
High value high reward
I invest 500 
I wonder if there is a template subreddit, just with templates 
All in my mans
Switch panel 2 and 3 and you have banger.
I dig the template, I'll throw a few shekels in.
This is basically another “that damned smile” template, and that took off.
I dig it
I f with it, throwing in a few coins
Shoveltrash memes now. Just bargain bin crap.

Its over. The market is saturated. Its crashing. 


Buy only 'memes are dead' memes, it will still be cheap but will pay off real soon. I can feel it.
You fucking kidding? 
Actually funny, invested 10 Billion. 
This has double the versatility, plus it requires a smidge more effort than other label memes.
This is hella old
It not being posted every 10 minutes
Old af my dude. 
TOO BRIGHT! eeehh
Shitting on other sub. I'm in!
Well FUCK ME DEAD. 14 bil down the drain.
WHY THE FUCK DID YOU DELETE???

This is a repost. im actually still waiting on my unsuccesful investment from the last one.. 2 hrs from now..
I don't think it's worth it
Just the Lisa Simpson meme
This has potential lads 
Quality. Made me laugh and it's not a label meme. Excited to BUY! 
Format: https://www.reddit.com/user/MajorGrizzly/comments/96hp40/format/?utm_source=reddit-android
Garbage don't invest, this whole format is over played
Damn, this is older than me
no longer fresh, probably won’t break 20 upvotes unfortunately 
My dude this one is ancient. Prolly won’t get over 20 upvotes. 
Old meme, horrible investment. 20 upvotes at the most. 
Need template!!!
I’ve seen this exact format at least 4 times in the past day
Literally same thing as the introduce you to my religion text format
If I could actually read the tweet then I’d consider investing
I'd say bad investment, it'll probably cap around 10-20 upvotes, sorry
Please, please, keep them on. For the love of humanity.
Can you pay me to look at this meme?

When there is almost twice as many investors are there are upvotes 
I'm getting back in line!

I see what you did there, and I'm not falling for it.
This meme is so old. Do you even know what sub you’re on right now?
Cmon man
This format is so old 
Hello welcome to variation 120378 of the fucking drake meme!

It’s the same format guys.

Still a fucking label meme

isn’t this the “guy with bear trap almost gets his hand killed by bear trap” meme
It's just another drake meme reskinned
Meh
Why did it turn? There’s nothing in the second frame to turn the plane around?

Normally it says something about your credit card info but not here
This could be quite a promising new format.
Although I like the meme, it is very old and the template is old too
Wat
Ehhhhhhh. Waaat
Eh, trying to hard to be meta 
Whatever floats your boat
No thanks. 
 I agree with you but I like the bot. I think the bot brings a lot of redditors to the sub, and I don’t necessarily believe that it’s preventing potentially promising new meme templates to light, despite having turned the comment section into r/WallStreetBets. I also can’t really see the bot going away atm because it’s so popular. I’m by no means a meme professional, tbh I mostly lurk and invest to try to understand meme culture cuz I was a little late to get in to it, but I think you might need to be the change you want to see in the world on this one and start bringing the comment section back to its roots. I  honestly think that would be welcomed. 
I agree. Ever since Investorbot came to the sub. This sub has been flooded with garbage.
I’m new here, and before I came here I thought this sub would be for in-depth discussions about meme trends. It would be lit if it could be that way. I like the investment part too, but I think we should just leave it at investing and not make it all about the investment. Just collapse the bot comment and discuss the potential of the meme.
Here here! This man speaketh the truth!
Should be a trapcard or quickplayspell
that's like the 20th repost of that in the last 10 hours

Old news man
There’s so much potential here.  I love this.  Could you make an example meme for us?
I'm out on this one. Easily see this meme getting taken in by incels.
This format has existed for a long time. It didn't have a ton of popularity.
Fresh memes get no upvotes, meanwhile this old one gets 500... Makes no sense 
why does the have investments
The ease of editing will likely lead to quick normification. Invest with caution.
It’s my first time posting on here, is this title right? Also do you think this has advantages over the Kylie Jenner “next thing I knew, I was pregnant” format?
I thought she had the biggest tits ever got 10 seconds.
. . . 60 Inches?

...inches short of 6 foot.

Roses are red, violets are blue, I am 6'3 , and this is not true.
Smh, Hobbits are mad again 
Great idea but would be much more profitable with a Waluigi format
“65 inches, is what I was going to say”
!balence
Blorch
Colourstion of text can be better with more options than in the base IPhone software, but otherwise its valid. Chance of over saturation and ‘normification’, but likely to gain a high short term reward.

I’ll edit in a template here once it’s up.
All in. Need this to make up for a bad investment from earlier today.
wait why woud we need a space force maby there are aliens in space that we dobt know about oh god no dami to casita
Agreed. Thats for the comments to decide

But if you’re just posting for input its fine
some even include  (repost)  in the title like it would help them
Is that suzuki?
This is basically just a copy of that scooby doo post... sorry cant invest

#Upvote, invest, downvote
Isn’t it just the heavy “that thing it scares me” meme?
I fear no man, but that *thing* IT scares me.
That's how I feel about this subreddit...
Great meme lots of potential!
Normification is the objective! It leads to the highest yields!
My biggest problem with this template is the lack of symmetry
It has potential. Though limited, it is worth a small investment
This one's going straight to the front page 
Going all in on this
I mean this kinda disgust me but it has potential so I invest

Yeah I mean..idk
Was already a big thing last year
i've seen this meme like 6 Times since Yesterday and people are still investing 
This is my final investment for the next few hours OP. Don’t let me down! 
Old format but accurate message.
This meme is dated woul not invest if i were you, also a repost of a repost.
so much versatility
this has been posted so many times today
Boooo! You stink!!!

Repost, do not invest

Has reposting this become a meme on its own now?
I agree with the woman who agrees with her husband. 
Don't forget to downvote, invest and then upvote. This has the potential to go to the moon. Make it happen.
Maybe pre-season 8. After that all of the original writers were gone and they did a complete 180 from being counter culture to pop-icon worshipping. The jokes went from being layered and complex to punchline/laughtrack-driven. Even the core characters became shallow husks of their former selves, and went from being sympathetic and intricate to simple vehicles for goofy gags.

Unless this was meant to be r/wooosh bait in which case I stand ready.
Both are shit imo
I could see the format primarily used for fbi vs. incognito mode memes. I’d say invest 
Invest fast before it’s not profitable
Considering half the people who played red and blue are parents now themselves, I’d say yes it’s too late
Can this sub post actual OCs instead of reposts from last year?
I’m 21 and I never experienced Pokemon. It’s for the better as Pokemon is a gateway to anime and other faggotry.
Format shows promise, but needs a real title. Investors beware. 
Don't invest It's not diverse unless you know how to Photoshop
Huh. Could have sworn I sorted by new, not controversial
This is the one boys and girls

You say they aren't funny. And I agree many of them I roll my eyes at but I'd say I nod, half smile, think about chuckling (which is the equivalent of lol) at about 2/5 of them posted. 
The problem is that they DO allow for pretty large profit margins, at least recently; that’s why the market has become so over-saturated

What exactly is an unhealthy amount of adderall?
Or you could just move to /r/labelmemes
Label memes are stale
Nice try. This meme is DOA
But 3.0 is bad
Doesn't he hold up the sky or am I getting that wrong?
i actually use adderall bc i have adhd so this is almost accurate for me
hasnt this already been a meme template
Can I get this template thoooooo?
Be careful adderal fucked my heart up PVC and PACs  for days. 
Ahhh yes. Adderall 
wait who is that person holding the earth actually?
A 3.0?? Wack 
Fuck every one of you hoes that takes Adderall without ADHD. Because of people like you it makes it harder for people like me with ADHD to get medicine I need so I can remember to do things like brush my teeth and attend school. 
8in and 100mg
I don’t see a “me” on that rock
I say this as an alcoholic scientist, unless you have several very specific conditions, get the fuck off that shit!  Earn your dopamine and serotonin.   Otherwise. Your feelings of joy will be hollow.  
Broken meme, using adderal for actual relevant majors (engineering) will burn you out long before you get a degree if you’re using it as a crutch 
I've never tried any adhd stimulants to help study, does it actually help?

Are there healthy amounts of adderall? 
Are you asking for an appraisal?
I don’t see any potential 
op, can you explain what the meme format is here or are you just trying to get updoots

I dunno, u/ohsopoor is a pretty sketchy name...
Eh. Not feeling it really. We already had lots of similar formats and this one isn't super unique. 
It's not a trebuchet, doesn't get my investment. 
Add a tiny bit of deep-fry to the final frame and I'll be a serious investor 
Maybe with less panels. 
Or we don't ban label memes, but the people making them just be more creative.
people will get tired of them and start downvoting eventually
The reason people post them is because they do well.. soon they will fade out
It doesn't matter, were heading into a meme recession anyway so...

Any photoshop gods here that can change that  Is not  to an  Are not  without it looking like complete cancer. Would be appreciated 
Op if this is OC, which it very well may not be, but if it IS you're very brave for posting it for your peers to judge it. Now that I've said that, just know that Its fucking awful. Like its been done before, even if you or i haven't seen it, its been done. Maybe not trending or top or hottest or whatever. But tucked away in some group text or facebook page where it belonged, forgotten. You're better than this bro. You and i and anyone seeing this know you didn't look at this and think  man this is clever, *im actually quite proud* of this . Don't just sink into the monotony of posting garbage that's popular at the moment, instead dig deep and use that ingenuity that is buried somewhere waaaay down within you and contribute something you can be actually proud of.

Entirely new format? 
How does this work? Is it something that’s across all subreddits?

What is the symbol in the bottom left? Actually, are these icons? What does the gnome kid represent? Just gnome kid?
What's the one in the bottom left?
What's top left, please?
I would like to know the top left icon, thank you.
How is the top left one called?

A very refreshing template 
I love pineapple on pizza.

I've already seen similar variations of this, with rubbish in the last panel. Not investing 
That’s mafia 
I would invest on it for a short period of time, it's kind of versatile
Don’t say thank you to the bus driver. Instant karma.
Just pineapple is indeed gross, as that much would be overpowering. Pineapple and pepperoni however is delicious. 
OP... what does the original say? I’m terribly curious.
You have a wrong Title, but the pun Dude...
This should've soared, what happened? 
I personally wouldn't invest in a repost from another sub. No versatility!
I see a porn joke here 
Not sure how this would be modified.
Going to avoid investing in this one.
Post this on r/wowthanksimcured for some free karma.

Well fuck
Repost of a repost
Can we rename this sub to r/LabelMemeEconomy or something
All these text memes are creating a bubble. Kids on Snapchat are flooding he market with these. Wake up people, it's time to stop reposting the same shitty text memes
Invested my life's savings OP. Take care of me
Wow another label meme, please keep them coming we definitely need more
it really be like that
Same meme, different picture
Label memes are dead. Stay away.
This sub is just Facebook now 
I invested my liver
The concept behind this sub was funny for like a week four years ago, which I'm pretty sure is before this sub even existed. We get it, it's like Wall Street but for the stupidest shit in the world.
And this is where I unsubscribe. This sub hasn't posted an original format for months.
Invested 10mil, pls dont fuck me over
I’ve invested my children
Label memes are trash
Let’s do a boudoir shoot in this hotel, I’ll pay for the room don’t worry, it’ll be a great addition to my spank bank-.. I mean your portfolio.
This sub is trash. Lol. Any picture, add text!! Invest now!!!!
It’s a flooded market though.  I am seeing tons of variations of this.   It’s only true value is in the Star Wars image itself.  Even then I am only seeing this in limited situations.   

If your looking to make a quick buck on a short sale but personally I am looking for more long term.   I want to retire someday after all!

Oh boy, this is a risky stock option, but it could pay well.

Edit: I would also add that the font color isn't doing any favors here. New memes need to be presentable for best ROI.

You're walking in the woods
There's no one around and your phone is dead
Out of the corner of your eye you spot him:
Shia LaBeouf.

He's following you, about 30 feet back
He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint
He's gaining on you
Shia LaBeouf

You're looking for you car but you're all turned around
He's almost upon you now
and you can see there's blood on his face
My God, there's blood everywhere!

Running for you life (from Shia LaBeouf)
He's brandishing a knife (It's Shia LaBeouf)
Lurking in the shadows
Hollywood superstar Shia LaBeouf

Living in the woods (Shia LaBeouf)
Killing for sport (Shia LaBeouf)
Eating all the bodies
Actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf

Now it's dark and you seem to have lost him
but you're hopelessly lost yourself
Stranded with a murderer
you creep silently through the underbrush

Aha! In the distance
A small cottage with a light on
Hope! You move stealthily toward it
but your leg! Ah! It's caught in a bear trap!

Gnawing off your leg (Quiet, quiet)
Limping to the cottage (Quiet, quiet)
Now you're on the doorstep
Sitting inside: Shia LaBeouf

Sharpening an axe (Shia LaBeouf)
But he doesn't hear you enter (Shia LaBeouf)
You're sneaking up behind him
Strangling superstar Shia LaBeouf

Fighting for your life with Shia LaBeouf
Wrestling a knife from Shia LaBeouf
Stab him in his kidney
Safe at last from Shia LaBeouf

You limp into the dark woods
blood oozing from your stump leg
But you have won; you have beaten
Shia LaBeouf

Wait! He isn't dead (Shia surprise)
There's a gun to your head and death in his eyes
But you can do Jis Jitsu

Body slam superstar Shia LaBeouf
Legendary fight with Shia LaBeouf
Normal Tuesday night for Shia LaBeouf
You try to swing an axe at Shia Labeouf

But blood is draining fast from your stump leg
He's dodging every swipe, he parries to the left
You counter to the right, you catch him in the neck
You're chopping his head now
You have just decapitated Shia Labeouf

His head Topples to the floor, expressionless
You fall to your knees and catch your breath
You're finally safe from Shia Labeouf ...

Sometimes I jerk off to her. I don’t watch the porno but rather the ad. You can jerk it to anything if you’re horny enough

Sometimes it really be like it do like that sometimes, but then it do.
There’s an iFunny watermark. Don’t invest.
Pretty solid investment. The ifunny watermark won’t affec the image due to the fact that you can find an unwatermarked one daily on r/hmmm, r/cursedimages, and r/2meirl4meirl

Wrong sub
Bruh I'm not a doctor but I'm pretty sure sweat juice is actually just sweat
template 

this would be a perfect maginot line meme
Bad set up with no clear direction 
I am selling my undertaker figurine for this format.

EDIT: I regret it.
This is by no means  easily memeable . Label memes with 2 labels are enough of a stretch already, but with 4 most people won't be able to follow the joke.
I feel like the antiperspirant makes the stains worse
Upward basketball memes are solid 

This is promising!
All credit for the meme goes to u/saraharas18 I didn’t make it. I found it and decided it could go here

Could even go (left to right) -  crippling anxiety and suicidal thoughts.  ,  Drugs  amp; alcohol.  ,  Me 
People actually, truly, hold onto the illusion of free will. The idea that people can and will fix problems themselves is a cancer, instead humans behave predictably.
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!
Oddly enough I think /r/memeeconomy kills more memes than it creates. 
Downvote before investing then upvote after for max profit!

Holy shit everyone! Thank you so much for the investments. I never would have expected one of my memes to blow up like this!
Truths
This was gold many moons ago 
Thank god i hadnt invested all my memecoins yet
Edit: I posted this comment in the text above and I guess I’ll hijack this one now to ask a few questions:

What would you like to (realistically) trade memecoins for or fields to expand memecoin investments? Can you think of anything else useful you might want to do with them? 


How would you feel about a fundamental change in the bot to a more stock-exchange type? This will probably mean more effective due diligence before investing and a potential to lose more in investments.


Do you think it’s possible to return to better quality posts without altering the investor bot? 
I agree

Remember to downvote after maturity for that pump and dump action.
It's because most non label memes are established naturally over time and trying to artificially making one needs creativity
My only regret is not going all in. 
How do I make a meme with this type of format (white boarder with text) using my phone? I can’t see to find the right font...
All in boiz 
Honest question; have any label memes ever gained any traction outside of this sub?
When does he stop straining? —im in. 
Take it to the top boys
Say what you will, I love label memes. They’re like old fashioned political cartoons.
This might be the first time I upvoted in this sub
I don't even enjoy r/historymemes anymore because no matter what the content, it's just label memes with either flags or faces on normal memes.
Invest in self aware memes 
Investing for the future of /r/MemeEconomy!
We need more musical and video memes, as well as caption memes!
If only the EU is a meme fan...
What is this non-label you speak of?
I go out to eat with my skimpy profits over the past few days and miss the investment of a lifetime?
They're telling easiest to make
I don't understand anything about this garbage reddit and I think you're all fools. Invest in my balls. 
How long until it rips its pants?
Non-label?
This is a paradox.
I can't tell if this page is satire or not. That being said. You can't predict what memes will become popular. Memes are cultural, not a business. If this is all for fun then I understand. 
It’s about time lol
This is basically a label meme. You just made a caption for the label. 
How ironic.  I actually made a post that was about r/memeeconomy to **stop with the label memes** because they are easily containmenable with normies.  But it got down voted. 
you're still labeling it you dingus
I warned you all of this, but no, you didn't listen.
Just a little more, you almost have it.
This is literally a label meme
I can maybe see a short term investment I would invest cautiously. 
Because you didn't attach the image properly 
Solid idea, but could've been executed better for more reliable quality.
eh, maybe if OP cleaned up the white mess going on
Does anyone have a template of this that doesn't look like a battlefield of Whiteout?

Like the meme, cant invest in the current market though. 
rebrand of the skulls meme?
Could you provide an example?
If my money wasn’t tied into current assets I would 100% be investing in this 
But now!!! Lol
People who dont thank the busdriver
 gt;use to say

It's a risky investing in a meme with a typo, be careful. 
Not another teen meme!
Ooh, this ones gonna explode.
This could be the start of something great
I have a lot invested! Don't let me down OP
......most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick  amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase  Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,  which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick  amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
This has nothing to do with memeeconomy wtf

What is this? Multi-meme drifting? I’m in
I like this one. High-effort, meta, references other memes.
Like a mirror cabinet
Did anyone watch the Spiderman cartoon when they were a kid and remember how hot Firestar was?
This one has great potential - invest early!
I’ve been looking for a chance to take. Gonna take this one.
I’m all in. 
Not going to lie. I feel as though this meme requires too much knowledge of memes to truly understand and will limit its potential as a viable meme format.
This is amazing. 
Accessible, ~~somewhat new format~~. Looks promising.

Edit: not new at all, do not buy!
I have no flipping clue how investing works and I don’t care to look it up so can someone just explain how it works to me?
Non label meme, I see some potential in this 
Reposted and dead
This is funny bc I’m imagining a kid who plays Fortnite making a meme
I can appreciate the idea, but this looks a bit unpolished
Oi oi is that from extra history
The original pic is from extra history. This is my first Memeeconomy meme so it probably sucks. 
I only invested because someone commented on the original that this would happen so I did it for the lolz and I had some extra coins

Edit: That person is u/LittleRedLamps
This is an unfamiliar level of meta. Very nice, but wouldn't invest.
Repost from the top of the hot page...

Edit: oh, it's supposed to be a joke. 
OP's an idiot. 
repost! Investors beware!
This is already rising, DON’T BUY
Reeeee

And a worse one too
Nice irony but it’s a repost, don’t recommend investing
Label meme 
This is bad and you should feel bad OP
nephew delet this
For what type of meme?
 go commit die  memes might be on the rise, but toaster bath is declining
Deathpacito
K this is one of the greatest shitposts I've ever seen. 
I feel like brain expansion memes shouldn’t have more than maybe 6 panels maximum.  Also, the “go commit” meme seems fairly old to me, though I have been seeing more often lately.  I feel like this meme could have been better with like four panels like “kill yourself, go commit die, go commit not alive, liven’t” or something like that.  I invested a small bit because I feel like there’s potential but I’m not so sure.
i'm new to meme economy but isnt there meant to be a bot up the top
`git commit -force -die` is a command that should exist.
Investors beware! This exact meme, not just the template, has been posted several times the last few days
**DIVEST DIVEST**, it's a repost lads.
How many rules does this violate?
Normie meme. Plus anything that starts with  The face I make when...  is probably shit.
Old meme... lets bring it back 
This is an ad, fuck off

Label memes
Label meme GTFO retard
I don't  get the point of this meme. Woosh me all you want, but I do want to know how to use this. Then I'll invest. 
I agree with u/karlovious.
Could OP elaborate on how you would use this format in a lucrative manor?
When she starts wanting kids.
 The bubble is going to burst pretty soon
Format's been to saturated, albeit just with a different image. Not investing on this one boys, doesn't feel innovative enough for me.
This ones gold, buy quick!

Uhh, hate to burst your bubble here, but you can't just post a picture and call it a 'non-label' meme. If you have an idea of how to actually use the format, by all means post an example. But to me it looks like any other picture that you'd slap some labels on and call a meme. 
Variation of so many similar templates. do not invest. Terribly derivative 
Can I Invest negative memecoins?
Thanks for the post man, really needed it in these hard times :) in return you get my investment

Weak font choice and doesn't make use of the blurry jpeg image well. Could have been better. Advise against this one.
Why tf is everyone investing in this? The original comic was making fun of the fact that there were too many scroll of truth formats and that loss was pretty much everywhere. You literally just edited it back to the original

Stop telling people where they should invest, it’s an open economy. 
When you post something that’s not a meme... 
Dropped a fat 50k hope this does well
DONT INVEST, repost

Sounds like we need some sort of superhero to restore the dankness

Watermark devalues it. Still a pretty solid investment nonetheless
So sad....invest if you cri evrytime 
How exactly are you entitled to give advice tho? Your net worth is 4k...
I can't figure out where I know this screen shot from. OC?
My paycheck relates to this.
Sucks
Yeah, this one actually has potential.  No SB and versatile.
For a moment I was worried gamingcirclejerk had ditched the northern Ireland theme
This won’t take off, don’t invest!

Edit: I knew it
Invest with care, this format has already been uploaded multiple times today.

Has potential, but poorly executed.

Using the meme wrong. He sees more clearly when he takes the glasses off because he became spider-man. This sort of mistake is unacceptable.

You’re using the meme format wrong
Downvoting because the meme is backwards

 punchline 
Megamind memes are due for a comeback. Starting rumors of a Megamind sequel could send the price skyrocketing in the short run, but be sure to sell quickly as prices will sink after a day or two.
Change title they will take this down
That's gonna be a 'no' from me dawg.
Old format, already has a know your meme page.
Wouldn’t invest.
Heheh you should have wrote in the speech box: this is an old meme  but no hard feelings i like this format
The amount of people that doesn't recognize such a classic meme format that is at least 1 year old is really scar(r)ing me on such a subreddit.
But it's old
This is it, boys. Meme of the day

Kinda shooting yourself in the foot there op
You guys realize this format died like a year ago right
Has a typo and uses Big Bang Theory, sell this immediately if you own it. 
I’m looking at this format and the comments and I am simply flabbergasted. This format is old! Like, six months old! It’s already in circulation! Hell, just google “Wreck It Ralph 2 Baby Meme” and pretty much every video is from March of this year. The format is dying, and I would NOT recommend investing if you haven’t already.
Love this format. Love the meme bot. Don't forget to thank him after investing for an extra 10% gain.  
This format died pretty quickly after the trailer.

Do not invest.
The versatility is so versatile. Invest in versatility!!!!!
This one is blowing up fast, downvote, invest, upvote!
Very relatable.

Gonna invest
Y'all fucking faggots that think you are so smart because you use big words. Fuck off in boutta simplify this for you faggots. This meme is funny but it's really fucking old. Use it if you want, no one fucking cares. Y'all gotta get your heads out of your asses and go enjoy nature
I Believe
All the time
I like the format, it’s new and it isn’t hard to change. Current use of it is way overused but upvoting for the format. 
jumps from window
https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1346457-wreck-it-ralph It can also be an old format.
Well, now we know that OP’s either a retard or a normie.

Remember when the Wreck It Ralph 2 trailer came out? Yeah, this memes been done.

Downvoted, unsubbed, and will not invest.
Another repost lads
I don't think this is a meme.
this isn’t a meme-template, not even a meme
This doesn't really belong here.... Misclick? 
As someone who has suffered tremendously with OCD over his life, little organizational quirks are often a false stereotype about OCD. While someone with OCD can have a compulsion that makes them do things of an ordinal nature, for the majority of sufferers, this either doesn’t exist or isn’t the main characteristic of the illness. OCD is really about horrific anxiety-inducing intrusive thoughts and the urge to do whatever it takes to get them out of your head.  This not only leads to a variety of compulsive tendencies, but also cyclical thought ruminations and often, suicidal thoughts - OCD sufferers are 10x more likely to commit suicide. 

My point is that many people have a false conception of what OCD really is and oftentimes unintentionally trivialize the nature of the illness.
Save your Queen memes until Bohemian Rhapsody (the film) releases.

Does illegible jibberish excite you, OP? Do you find it erotic? 
What is this even meant to be?
Did you deliberately make the most incomprehensible garbage you could possibly come up with?

The labels are inconsistent and randomly placed.

Couldn't decide on a colour so you used all of them.

Tried to cover every pixel of the image with mismatched text.

Chose some of the worst text colours for the background making it shit to read.

Frame 2 has a text box that for no reason isn't completely transparent.

The first 4 frames don't line up square.

Low quality starting template resolution.

It's a no from me. 
I don’t get it...

Edit: ok I get it, still not really investing though 
This is so sad

I like the meme but it was actually Andrew Jackson who changed the 40 acres and a mule law into giving the land back to the owners pre civil war. and then there was all this land but no work force. so former slaves and poor whites became sharecroppers 
Example?

This one is only saved for daylight savings time!!!!
I feel like I’ve seen this one before...
The market seems to be saturated with either label memes or meta memes, I’m not confident on this format.
seems like it is a little too complicated visually, and since label memes rely on the template being simple to see and understand, I’m not sure I’m very confident in this one.
True fans will be upset about the “I” situation
Easy normie potential especially because there are wheel of fortune answer generators online...
This should be performing better imo
GRAND AUTISMO NIGGAZ
My bad
Guess I'll just invest in this then
Label memes are over saturated, I don’t recommend this
Well aware this is a label meme but, it isn’t a common label meme. (X hitting Y or object X going towards object Y)
That was actually a half decent show

Strong. I’d definitely invest if only I didn’t have this crippling student loan. 
Great point. Shall take out third mortgage to invest. 
Also  gt; 1 upvote per minute for the first hour is a strong indicator for success.
Higher effort = more versatility typically. Obviously there are some outliers, but the potential a format has to be modified is usually directly related to its lifespan and overall worth.
Scroll of truth

Okey... how do I rotate text in paint?
Can someone please explain this to me??

What? A boo meme?? I'm in.
Serious here...can someone explain the memecoin and investing? How I acquire these items?
Boo is a bit shy but he can turn around.  Invest!
I can see this becoming a weaponized meme, you know, a meme used to push an agenda. Invest, but pay very close attention to it so it doesn't sneak up on you and spook you by plummeting in value.

Some of the most quality reviews I've ever seen
The meme is hot, though I don’t think you used it right here.
This meme hasn't banged the numerous times it's been posted in the 24 hours, and it won't now. I wouldn't invest. 
You best believe I'm gonna invest on some honest meta crap about some meta crap about memeeconomy. And you cant stop me

In general the more upvotes the submission you invested in gets the more meme coins you earn. The formula rewards more people that buy early for example if you invest when the submission has 1 upvote you will make money if it reaches 35+ upvotes.

If you invest at 1000 upvotes you will make money if it reaches 1500+ upvotes. So you have different tactics I guess. Invest early on what you think will get many upvotes to make more money or invest on the things that rise quickly for a safer (if you do it right) investment.

How 
Okay although this is just my opinion, everyone except iFunny users knows that’s it’s a normie website, so making a joke about it being a normie website would still appeal to all normies exept the ones on iFunny
Yeah but only I funny users would say something like “dankmemer”
So, first box you may put an event or a thought in there and in the last box, something relevant to the first or not. Just make it ironic

“When you” and label memes are over saturating the market. If we don’t see some diversity soon I fear there might be a market crash
is that Minecraft?!?!
It’s looking like it will be applicable to many situations, but at the end of the day it’s a label meme so I think it’s lifespan would over with the trend. 
Very good. 
There is a pencil crystal in the top right.
Poorly photoshop a diamond pickaxe over the pickaxe and some diamonds over the gems, deepfry it and call it a day. 
QI'm is peQPq
It's not a craze if it has carried on uninterrupted for years. 
I invest in this meme
What about 7 balls? I’d buy into that craze. 
ha
 Craze ? It's a fucking tide. It goes in and out.
Will the bubble ever burst?
Somebody make this a label meme and I'll upvote
Ok that's funny. You make this?

Bad template. Don't fall for the hype guys

Very similar meme with this same format  returned only 2/3 of the investment recently
Is this the new  she was already dead ?
It sounds like you want to make a label meme, which is the laziest kind of meme, but you don't want to put on the effort for it.

Now that's what I call meme-enterprising

Best movie, solid format
too similar too fantasy painting object labeling, will simply repeat history in a cheap way. don't invest
Sorry, no potential
it’s not a format if the joke only applies to one thing
That's an opinion.
I never understood some white peoples' obsession with wanting to use this word. It's just one tiny little word, just let them have it. Why do you have to be so petty about it?
I'm in love with this template, and subject matter just tacks on value, a bargain! 
Very nice template! Would buy any day.
Nigga plez 
Hey Jerome can you spot me a pass real quick. 
New idea: 100memecoin or 10% flat rate (auto invested into the post by OP). Thoughts on that? 
Concerns:

1. Volume of posts may go down as people may be risk averse. 

2. What about the redditors who aren’t investors? I’d imagine the vast majority of subscribers don’t even know the bot exists. I didn’t for a long time. Would they have an account automatically created when posting? Wouldn’t a 1,000 minimum immediately put them all in on the first post? I guess if they were unaware then it’s a nonissue, especially if this sub will be differentiated by requiring all posters to be in the economy. 

3. If I’m below 1,000 balance then can I not post?

Overall I like the idea!!!!
The investment bot is what killed this sub. Making further use of it is only going to make it worse.
I think the value is high, but appropriate.  This would really lead to more thought before posting, although it may lead to more conservative, 'gaurenteed profit' posts.  It could increase saturation in big name formats, but other than that I love the idea
As a Creator and part-time investor, can I invest MORE than whatever number we end up on?  For example, if I am super confident in my product, can I ONLY invest 10% or is that the minimum? (Using the hypothetical numbers from the poll)
Yes, but posters should also get income based on amount invested by others. Companies benefit from having a lot of investors, not just the investors.
Shitty meme dont invest
Yes! I put this idea up a week or so ago. Will stop so many crappy posts and benefit posters. Please do this! :)

Here was my original post

https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/949g0s/idea_for_the_sub/?st=JKUGTBVR amp;sh=e029cc01
Are memecoins a real thing like a cryptocurrency? New and confused. A bad combo
Not a bad idea BUT instead of the standard calculation of return for a poster, the poster should receive MemeCoins as part of a function that measures the total MemeCoin wealth created over a 24 hour time limit due to the post. 
I like the idea and I have a question I don’t know where to ask so I might as well try here: what is the delay before upvote count is visible on a post? I know u can see by checking investments but I’d like to know when it’s visible at the top of the post
Nah, if you dont have decent karma then your stuff just doesnt get seen 
As a non-investing lurker, how would this affect me if I came across a format I'd like to share?
Do away with the 10% just 1000 or a stepper price and let that poster post on the sub forever. Something like 20000 MemeCoin?
No taxation without representation.
Im not in it for the coin, im in it to help others with original content.
feedback

(yes, i am posting feedback in this post)
I HAVE a sure invest
I want to post graphs and other visuals of the popularity of current memes.  However these are not accepted on this sub despite it being the actual point.  So adding this feature would be great as long as people are willing to accept that as a part of this sub
I think there should be an option to do this so that people don’t have to risk their memecoins to make an actual post.  
I think that if that's going to be implemented, companies and stuff have to be implemented so you're rewarded for posting a meme.
Is there a return when posting?
How do you deal with the suppression of OC?
Here’s an unpopular idea: get rid of the memecoins.

Imo they have made the sub worse tbh.
Anything is better than what you have now. It's picture + text slapped over it. Nothing thought out and could be done with a multitude of photos.
How about OP has to give a certain percentage of lost coins back to investors. 
 gt; No (leave feedback in comments)

ur mom gay
100-1000 in your own post seems reasonable, 10% is way too much tho.

Oh another label meme what a surprise
This is the book that coined the word 'meme' in a different context though. I don't get the reason to invest in it though.
I completely agree and I don't understand how people think memes can be created without labels considering a caption is just a label you put on the side. 
Well it’s usually the same joke, just with different formats
Definitely not. Label memes are lazy, not creative and very non ironic. They cannot spread rapidly as do non label memes. It'll Just keep us in this recession.

I think this is an amazing meme that’ll be used frequently, but this sub needs to upvote so we get the proper return on investment! (Ie it’ll be used a lot but i don’t know if the sub will upvote enough, let’s hope we all do our part for great templates/memes!)
Not too versatile 
This is the firefighter meme that was already beaten to death
This would have better potential if it was cropped correctly
The original fidget spinner
This is just a rehash I wouldn’t invest
This is very similar to the 'she was already dead when we found her' meme. I suggest caution.
This is the scroll of truth rehashed. Not much potential for growth
The template itself can be taken as a meme
It's already been posted several times tho
Example 1 - trebuchet memes 

https://www.reddit.com/r/trebuchetmemes/comments/97hgzs/blocked/?st=JKV2ETC1 amp;sh=d8ab337d

Update* failed meme

7 ups after 3 hours 

17 ups after 12 hours 
I’d use that meme
Similar to many memes,

\-dolphin chasing woman 

\-muscular tom

and many others. However ill  invest because such memes have high market demand
This meme was overused months ago... it's the epic monster meme. This is a terrible investment.
Literally just another label meme
Why do we still consider different label memes to be different formats?
Try 15 :P
Is there a sub that dedicated to this kind of artworks?
Relatable meme, not meta.

I saw this meme a week ago on Facebook. The market is already saturated. Don't buy.
 I can’t even tell if this is a repost because I don’t know what it says 
Meme violates rule 1! INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK!
I invested without thinking holy shit
I'm colour blind but with blue and purple
How can you invest in this meme? There is no potential for growth
Breaks rule 1 and is a VERY old meme. It’s been around for at least six months.
You can't make other variations of this though 
Fuck im colourblind
What does it say 
I can’t read it
I don't have anything to invest, but I'll upvote
I would be in trillions if this didn’t break rule 1
the feeling when i cant read it
I'm goin' all in on this one boys!!
What does it say?
I legit can’t read this
Am colorblind please explain
Sorry for anyone who invested because, THIS WAS MY FIRST POST, again sorry 
little to no potential for growth, only variations would be loss. after that only normified variations would be left which would be bad for sales. don't invest.
Wait don’t invest it breaks rule 1, so the mods might delete it. Be very careful 
What is it im colourblind
It says  we must rise against the color blind

Low value, no potential due to single use format and outdated joke. 
Garbage
Reposti
I think it's an easy label meme, but the possibilities are endless. The format would be 'label' with maybe a line pointing down. (I don't have the abilities to do that from my current devices).

Possible labels:

'We're having Uncle Ben tonight.'

'Mary Jane's dating Flash Thompson'

'We know about Gwen'

'We're sending you to space'
invested everything, don't disappoint me
wish I had been here earlier I like this one a lot 
This is just.. terrible. 
An old format with a stale update. Do not invest!
This is... An old format
I’ve done this more times than I’d like to admit
This may be it. We may have hit gold. Go for it boys. 
Especially when it then gets 1000 upvotes in a hour but you don't notice until it's too late. 
How do I convert life savings into memecoins 
So glad to know that I'm not only the incompetent one.

Ahh, I remember when I was 12 and made memes. 
This one's a stinker

Honestly I’m just surprised that they actually made an effort to match the source font. 
the post brought me to my first 100k, much love  lt;3
This is an old format
https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/90oauv/worth_investing/?utm_source=reddit-android this meme format was on this sub 25 days ago. Furthermore, this meme has been on knowyourmeme.com for 6 MONTHS! Why is this dead stock being upvoted and invested in on this once glorious subreddit?
This was right below a r/furry_irl post
The truth has been spoken.
( . _ ) .
Please excuse my ignorance but I'm new here. Is memecoin a thing and if so how does it work? 
How is it gay if it's a female fox?
Over 200 comments and not a single upvote?!?!

Also wtf are those eyes
Whoopsie wrong sub
What happened to emuparadise! 
wait a minute emuparadise is dead?!

I keep saying...no more SB investments, and then I forget
THIS ONE'S REALLY TAKING OFF
I can see this being remade into some kind of Skyrim Khajiit meme however I lack the Photoshop skills for that.

Still the possibility is there.
maybe, but get in and out quick.  Before you know it, the normies will be here with some stabbo catto bullshit. 
Relatable for sure but idk if it's really versatile, I don't see how you could use it in another situation
This won't grow, but I like this :)
I just caught myself gonna complain about you complaining about rude people.... you have every right to complain, sorry I was being ignorant...

Don’t forget to upvote after investing!
You can replace “chocolate” with pretty much anything and label the dog with pretty much anything too...very versatile 
This is unbelievably versatile, low risk, definitely invest

Thats a ...odd fetish. 
The Instagram watermark is a nice touch 
Sauce on this meme?
The fuck kind of Snakes  amp; Ladders are you playing
Wish I had more to invest. 
Doesnt take too much thought. I check the bot and see real coins dropped, I follow the train.

So much potential! Like to see some more already
High risk, too much reading

The smart money is investing here. Going to be big. 
Bionicals are always a solid investment
this is actually really old and had it's peak quite some years ago. If you are optimistic and think this will get a new and different developement in the modern meme enviroment, go for it but be careful
How the hell is this fresh?  Literally years old.
We don't do that here
This is not new and fresh at all. This dates back to pre 2010 memes, it just has a bionicle in it. Definitely not investing.
Go fuck yourself and your shitty 10-year old meme
Get it while it’s hot, high risk high reward! 
More like the past, invest to LOSE STOCKS
Deconstructed.  I like it.
r/okbuddyretard
If by 'new', you mean a format that probably predates the concept of a 'meme', than you're right! This is literally just motivational/demotivational poster format.. 
#DO NOT INVEST  

This meme was not cropped properly, which means that the creator does not care about it.
All in. 128 trillion, take me to the promise lands

Edit: that’s the spot
Why is your hand almost crippled? Shouldve used those stimpacks
Notice how is arm is almost crippled too. Makes you wonder what he was doing on the toilet that whole time

Wow why is this blowing up?
Downvote invest upvote PROFIT.

This is gonna be big gainz
Memeeconomy is crazy sometimes. This is a repost from n hr ago and that one was stagnant as hell. Im not hatin, im just watching
Nothing worth investing in this one. 
This is literally a one meme format. It’s fucking trash
I doubt it’ll take off but I like the idea, and it’s something new 
This is very cool but it's also about 6 months old.
More than just potential, I’d say this can be the next Quicksaving meme, it’s relatable and versatile, I’m in.
In with 3 billion, don’t fail me
Fuxk it I'm in for 25k. 

This better turn my luck around for the day as I'm down 25k for the day lol
In for 3b. This one is going far.
I’m down to my last coin on this.  Better go big ALL IN 
The minecraft font really sells this. Great potential

This is posted 4 times, 3 of which have already shown up in my feed lol

Nice Minecraft font
Yes, this could be a possible meme. But, would be hard not to top puss n boots meme that’s pretty stale by now. 
Prequel memes are a pretty safe bet
The fact that vice thinks pee being stored in the balls is an alt right conspiracy is a meme in itself 
It’s a repost, be careful investing
Ooooh god i remeber his voice....
I'm sorry but this has already latched onto twitter for almost a week, a tad late for this investment
Stop just fucking shouting BUY BUY BUY over every post.
Low Quality
I want this to become huge but it wont :(
Go big or go home! 
All in with 26k, I think this is gonna be huge.
Don't forget to thank the meme bot after investing for an extra 10% on your investment.  
Straight to the, top boys. 
The rumors are true... r/memeeconomy is the true meme
this one’s blowing up boys
This one will skyrocket.
3 upvotes per minute! This is the big one, boys
Smart and safe investment!
See ya on the top. 
Before this meme I was a trash boy.  But then I invested, and now look at me.  Success!

Invested to waste my last 1144. Let's see.
Shhhh... Do you want to attract the attention of the memes exchange commission!
It’s impossible to enforce
Can I petition the treasury to honor a more respectable historical meme figure on our currency? We are blessed with so many honorable memes to aspire to and yet we recognize Troll Face?
Not worth it.
Ew

Guess I have the same sense of humor as my 10 year old son lol.

I could see this being very snarky
I’m surprised we haven’t had more Phineas and Ferb memes 
So ridiculous it just might work 
That isn’t even a meme 
That time when Phineas lost his shit
In memes we trust. 

God bless America. 
Insider tip: invest in Clarissa explains it all memes. Quiet rumblings of Angry beavers.
If we’re doing P amp;F, can we get Milo memes too?
40k on this, you better not let me down, op
Phineas and Ferb memes need to happen!
Honestly I just invested for Phineas and Ferb.
Surprised there isn't a cult sub for this show with memes galore, it has a lot of untapped potential 
Damn. I invested small, and I should have went all in

Label meme making fun of label memes... 
I R O N I C
Fucking finally, easiest all in for weeks
This is still a label meme you fucking troglodyte
I've seen success with always sunny memes before. Don't let me down OP.
This my friends, still is a label meme. And that's the reason the label meme market won't crash, because it's very hard not to make one. 
You missed an opportunity to put Frank holding his  egg  
Since I see a ton of comments regarding this being a label meme, let me clarify: this post is intentionally ironic.  Not only is this a label meme, it’s also a meta meme, so it’s two out of three of the things the meme makes fun of in the first place. To me, that’s part of the humor of it.
In a simple man, I see IASIP I upvote and invest
So you like coc? What are you, a mod? 
Ongo glabogian?!
This meme is legitimately genius.
Listen to me

Keep the memes fresh by being original
After Spongbob, IASIP memes are among the most solid and best investments
This is fucking Meta, not original.
But this isn’t original...
You heard Danny guys. Get on it
Yo I love the font, how do I use that for my memes

Oh Ongo...

I understand the irony of it being a label meme, but what about the irony of it being an old meme? This has been around since my grandpa was mailing in stock trades.

Sorry, not a new format. I would not recommenced investing.
I see some potential here but I will wait before I invest 
This is going to be BIG!... maybe?
Why is there white text over the black one ?
don't you ever
Why do so many people post suicidal memes and depression memes?

Maybe the meme addiction and the computer addiction is the problem, not the savior?

Simpson references are the gold of memes, safe investment especially if the market crashes.

Type !help as a reply to the bot. You start with 1000 meme coins. You can invest coins by replying to bots of memes that you like. To make money, you need to count on the meme you invested in gaining many upvotes within 4 hours. After 4 hours, if there is growth, you will profit. Not enough growth, lose meme coins. There isn't a way to cash out. It cashes out automatically after 4 hours.

Btw I found this a r/pics a thought it may have some short lived potential as one of those text memes similar to that motorway one but with three variables. i.e thing targeted towards something but has an unintended effect on something else completely missing target. Haven’t come up with anything but post some of your own.
another shitty label meme. 
Joined meme economy over a week ago and this is the first meme that has actually made me blow air quicklyy through my nostrils.

If I knew how to invest I would go all in on this

Nobody types like that, and in itself is an old meme. Wouldn’t suggest investing

Could be worth liquidising a few assets for this one boys
Totally agreed
Plot twist: This is a repost 
I thought I already saw this exact meme on the front page? Hmmm
Should we wait for the repost?
Is this why I got banned from r/funny? They just banned me for no reason 
We've already got this format and in much higher quality too. Don't invest.
#DON'T INVEST!  

This is an old format that already has templates released.
This was already a think for a while there 
# BAIL ITS STALE
This is a repost.

The template was posted a few days ago.

Plus there have been about 30 different versions of this meme posted. So a blank template is definitely a repost.
Nice repost
this is a repost from literally minutes ago, wyd
It’s definitely versatile, but I don’t think I’d invest that much in it.
Is this legit OC or a repost 
It’s beautiful, hop on over to /r/bioniclememes 
Dude ur battery is low
This phones it battery is at 7% and needs charging. 

*This is not a bot and this action was not performed automatically. If you have questions about this human you may write to the moderators.*
I honestly wish you edited this image subtly, you could’ve changed what was up next on the bottom there. You could’ve put -3% on battery. Make the like numbers insanely high in that video and the dislike at 0.
#DON'T INVEST  

This picture is not properly cropped, which indicates that the poster does not care for it. It also means it will lose out on potential upvotes from people who are bothered by stuff like this.
I am in love with this buy buy 
Make sure to comment after investing. Keep up the solid energy to drive in fresh investment!
Solid meme very versatile 
*pulls out gun* SORRY!

Also, if you can just hyperspeed through a fleet of ships and destroy them why not do this every fucking time with an unmanned drone ship?
This might have potential, but is it versatile? 
Might not be versatile but this is gold
If you have to spend hours on a meme you should just quit making memes. Maybe 10 minutes, tops. 
That's actually quite original even for a label meme!

I love how the Wii was so popular it forced Sony and Microsoft to rip off their idea of having motion controllers. Way to come up with your own ideas, jerks.

This is pretty much a rant disguised as a meme.  
I hope this gains traction, promising meme but too early to invest.
If you wanna complain then don’t try to cover your ass by making it a meme
I passed this up, but I'm still upvoting because it made me smile.

Remember downvote then invest wait for confirmation,  wait for others to invest then upvote before the 4 hours is up. Be a friendly neighborhood ant-man.
Thank you to all the bots who invested in this - proving my point
Is it possible for a sub to hide comments for the first 30 minutes? then the bots may not be able to invest early anymore. 
If you don’t mind explaining, what’s an investor bot?
Seems like a pretty old repost, already featured on Comment Awards
This seems like a very wise business investment. This shit will be toppin', you know what I'm saying?
Useless format. What else can you even do with it? Isn't this also ancient?
This is ancient and also has 0 possibilities

This shit is getting out of hand

Dont see what the left have to do with anti-vaxes? I mean i guess we believe in personal liberty and thus maybe some of us believe in the right to not get vaxed, but we also know that herd imunity is a thing, thus making it not just effect them, and we definitely believe people should vax there kid.

This is actually a pretty smart meme. Only thing is.. There are only 4k subscribers online right now. New memes are averaging about 30 views an hour. Imo, this would do better if it was posted at peak hours.

#BEGONE THOT
don't put all your marbles in one basket the meme market has been taking some hard hits recently and due to all the same memes being put up to rotation it is making it even harder.
Considering this only relevent to niche market of meme economy I'm choosing not to invest as I don't see this going anywhere into the normie population of facebook. 
Why is this on the front page? This is months old. And you’re all acting like its gold.
Don’t be dissin mah Pokémon, man.

If you really wanted to hose them, wait until a few of them bite with big investments, then delete the post.

Remember to upvote after investing for maximum profits!
This post **is** both relatable and meta... but is in violation of Rule 1:

 gt; Submissions and submission titles must be related to the meme economy. For Example:  I found this meme,  is not OK.  I found this meme, should I buy or sell,  is OK. All post titles should reference buying or selling at a minimum, and you can browse the Investopedia Financial Dictionary if you need some inspiration.

You can repost with a title that directly references memes in an economic context.

going all in fellas
This is it fellas . Downvote, invest, upvote, go to sleep ,wake up in profits 
Looks promising. Don't forget to upvote after investing!

And thus begins my journey in speedrunning The Meme Economy. 

If I go all in, you know it’s a big one (hopefully). See y’all again in 4 hours.
Comment your hearts out
Memecoins are useless? I thought you could turn them into real money, like actually a crypto currency
This could be the next big thing I see the potential..

What happened to the original post of this meme? I was about to invest in that, but it disappeared 
They shouldn't lock a topic after so many people invested, or at least not remove the topic.
Well done sir

Excellent format, I see real potential
this is my favorite use of this format yet
All in baby, you better pay out.
Unpopular opinion: 99% of memes here can be used only for a handful of scenarios before it dies. Not a big buy. 
r/raimimemes is a hot commodity right now! Buy buy buy!
I know this is meme economy, but seriously last year a fellow teacher at my school had her nudes leaked 10 years later that she had given to her ex husband when they were married by his new wife. Shittiest kid at school leaked them. Nothing happened to kid. Teacher was forced to resign. Ruined her life, her children were harassed and mocked, I saw her just last week and she is still messed up.

Don't be this person, don't encourage this person.

That being said format is gold.
I GOT 1000 RIDING ON THIS. COME ON, SPIDEY! DADDY NEEDS A NEW PAIR OF SHOES!!1

Steady gains so far and passed 2 upvotes/min within an hour of posting. If this gets above 1k upvotes within another hour it's heading for the moon just in time for lunch breaks EST and evening scrolls in Europe. Be ready. 
This is MEGA old on /r/raimimemes, tread lightly
Truly beautiful 
100% in I need more Spider-Man memes in my life 
It's funny how some of the memes people suggest here are already overused in latin america because I usually think america set the trends on the internet. I guess it's new for a 6k redditors.

Speaking as someone who railed a high school math teacher (from a Christian academy no less) for a few months, they’d probably not stack up to real life.

Poor investment, We have seen this exact style of meme before. This is only a re-skin of it
A little bit long, but still quite funny and relevent. I say invest.
I've seen this before....

I don’t even think it’s very funny, but it’s doing well so fuck it

Harold is the Lord and Savior of MemeEconomy
ALL IN FOR 1 MILLION, SAVE ME OP
This one is landing on the moon! Take me there, Captain Harold!
Harold is always a safe investment, and will bring in steady returns. However, when used correctly Harold can bring in big stacks of memecoins, and I believe this to be a big hitter. Invest while it is still profitable.
Let’s take roldy to the front page 
Harold actually is in a commercial in Germany atm, so expect some added exposure through that
I’m kinda ashamed that I can relate to this. 
Can't make a comeback if he never left.
Be my saviour OP!
All in dog, be kind
Motherfucker Harold never left

I'm all for a Futurama trend, or even just retro memes, but I keep getting burned investing in these. You have my blessing and my upvote, but can't risk any M¢
I believe in you. All in.
Although the idea has potential, this particular meme is too... crusty. May I suggest trying something else, something... better.
Thank you so much for tapping into the extremely ignored market for Detroit Become Human memes.
She’s so beautiful. I’m late on the investments, but the upvote has been thrown. God bless you all. 
I know this is just the template, but choosing absolutely nothing over all those options is amusing to me

 Longer and worse version of the  which pill  meme. My guess? This is the meme's last hit.

This market has been saturated, divest immediately
let's face it, the bubble has burst.
WHY ARE YOU ALL INVESTING FOOLS THIS HAS 9 UPVOTES AFTER AN HOUR
I'm skeptical about this one ...
This format was already posted months ago, look in my post history.
Are you allowed to invest in your own posts?
SHE meme? Don't invest. 
Old Normie template with politics don’t invest.
r/teenagers tbh
You just stole a old format...

Edit: yes
Does anyone have this format?
Not quite a label meme, sign me up 
hahahhaha! happy to see my meme continuing onward.
I can nock evrybody ded but not myself :(
Too relatable.

This meme was big about a year ago. Not saying it’s dead, but it has already climaxed.

Hey that’s my meme, this is a pretty cool post!
I really hope this format goes big... best new meme I’ve seen lately 
I have invested all my memecoins.

Today is a fine day to die 
Detroit or high school?
It works really well because it plays to two cities, this is a buy. This one is going places. 
From Detroit, can confirm.
This is so sad, Alexa play nootnoot.mp3

I like this meme, but this exact format is quite old. Not investing. 
I dont often go all in, but this is clearly going to the top. Hittin it with 50k
Marvel is not really hot right now actually
I invested a little just to fuck Skype!
Ooh I like this one 
This is a repost U know 
The remainder of my pitiful investments for the day is going in on this top-quality meme!
Try closing a steam game that is set on full screen 
Way to go, you peaked it right out the gate.
Same with twitch
Task manager doesn’t even have skype on it
I agree, this image is fucking cursed. 
This is by far one of the worst pictures in existence. Easily.

Now this one I can get behind! Office memes are gold
You guys just wait hoping people forget about templates. 
I don't see the value but 22 comments and 10 upvotes in 20 minutes means I'm in with a small investment!
I'm sorry to be the dick to say this but... Cancer isn't that funny?
So bad
I agree this meme is so low quality AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Brooo tbh square though because I can find a family while I have lots of money to spend, but money can be hard to come by when you have a family to take care of.
Y’all just throwing everything you have at the wall and seeing what sticks now?

Bill Wurtz has to be profitable!
You could make a religion out of this
Bill Wurtz is one of the most underrated and underappreciated artists of this generation. I will invest 10% of my net worth into this meme because I would love to see his art utilized as meme material more often. Godspeed OP and Godspeed Bill Wurtz.


Nice template but overused format. Idk
pretty sure this is a repost
This is really old. Don't invest.
Are you serious? This is what you guys are upvoting? 
Wtf. How does this have upvotes? This a thousand years old.
This Is literally the only caption that works
How is this a meme when this is literally what is said wtf?
There isnt any adaptability... shit meme
Not versatile, this is literally the context of the scene
Really fuckin old, minimal potential for diversification and variation. Don't Buy.
What are mods doing?
Funny but doesn't seem versatile.
Did you just now start watching the show?
I occasionally like seeing Regular Show Memes on occasion but this is just old af m8 this is just a meme, not a meme template.
The top text is literally just the line of dialogue in the show that came before the one quoted in the bottom text. Also has absolutely no variability or versatility. It’s a no from me
Debating investment, the layout is what was originally said, I smell just a picture. we need more versatility for huge loads of investments
Why can't I get upvotes on anything while an ancient meme has over 4k on THIS sub?
please read this sub's rules to understand what it's about, retard
I was on mobile and saw that it had like 50 comments. All investments. Then i invest and it  says its still at zero upvotes. YOU GUYS GOTTA UPVOTE
So, any funny line spoken in any given show or movie minus the delivery and context can be considered a meme. Huh.
I invested in other memes 5 minutes before this came out. I need a loan.
So much bot lag! 
Hello darkness, my old friend

Pops memes are a long time coming
I lost 40% of my coins on the last meme. This subreddit is going downhill. 
I'm sick of these types of memes. They're so susceptible to normification and edgification. Don't invest, we need to get to new formats
This has no versatility
This doesn’t seem versatile in a way that would still make it funny
Oof thats a scary one
Are retro memes in now? What about ancient memes?
You are a douche OP
I personally find it eh but it's had amazing growth so
Remember to upvote after investing
In for 450. I just got my balance above 1K for the first time, fingers crossed I can keep that going.

Hasn't this been posted like 3 times today already?
Feel free to @ me, but if someone posts a fresh template (as the Lord intended BTW), and not an example for said fresh template, then making a post with that template is a definitive dick move. Should have posted as a comment under the original post.

I'll bite due to the potential. But I will invest warily because it is a label meme.
I'm wondering if it would be a better template by having the first image be of the Covenant ship *before* it begins glassing the area.

But I would trust Halo memes to perform well. Especially with the quality of the remastered cutscenes.

Edit: first image idea https://m.imgur.com/a/BHQPYhz
Too  much lens flare and text would ideally be different font, colour, and larger. Looks dated/oversaturated and can't really compete with cleaner, crisper variants that already exist
I think I got second hand autism looking at that
i cant read that and you want me to invest. thats a no from me
I do not understand. Sorry buts its a no from me.

Hmm, I think I'll hold on this one.  Commie propaganda memes could be on the rise though.  I'll be on the look out!
So what could the text be on the bottom of this meme to make it golden status? 
Seriously this is at least 2 weeks old

I like the thought process but dont think it has enough legs this late at night.

We’re at 2 upvotes for every 3 views chaps 
Ok now this is epic
Blackadder always gets my upvote, wish more people knew about that show.
Weird activity going on in this one. Why were three investment accounts created in the first few minutes of the same low potential meme? Reeks of market manipulation

All accounts were also created using the balance command, not create.

Invest now!
As I tell everyone, this is not a meme and not a meme template. This is a picture. For this to be a meme you need to make it a label meme, add a place to add something funny or add additional photos with it and give an example. 

Then as you post the example you can link a copy of the original or blank template in your first comment. Then it warrants investment.

Edit: reccomend not investing for investors. OP I reccomend you make minor changes to turn this great picture into a memeable post. No disrespect, just trying to give you valua le advice and stop this from continually happening.
It should be nurse joker 
Now where oh where was that recent post saying don't repost memes from other places saying:  INVEST INVEST INVEST 
I technically posted an old back to the future meme earlier that states 

 Doc we've gone back in time! 

 No Marty this is just a repost. 

And I swear to you I know mine was a repost and a shitty meme, but I told people not to invest. However, my meme proves true 10-30 times a day. 

Random:  I want karma. Oh I know I'll post something I found on a different sub, it's super old but I'll get upvotes! 

It is our job, no our duty, nay our obligation to downvote the hell out of these type of posts to discourage this behavior.
This isnt a meme, it's a picture.

Please if you're going to post a template post an example of how it can be done. Then in comments post a link to this template.
So based on my other comment, do not advise investing.
Wow this one got old quick

Only investing 1000 since it's so late but I see the potential.

Tge best thing is the meme would still work if the screen in the third panel remains empty, because he'd actually have saw nothing.

Again I want to point out that these is not a meme or a meme template, this is a picture. You need to add some sort of example of how it could be used or a second picture to make it a meme.

Do not invest.

This meme has 0 potential. DO NOT invest.
Sure but know your meme doesn’t try to be funny, they just give information about the origins. They aren’t trying to appeal to their audience and it isn’t cringy 
This could be ground breaking, investing in ideas, or simply the text that is versatile enough to be put on many formats. An untapped market!

Isn’t it a bit similar to the irrational number one? 
Wow, this is just awful
I don't like it because it's just way to much things going on here. Also there's no real path or point you can follow. The goal should be to make something you can easily follow and it should portray something in a funny and creative way. That's just my opinion but I think you could improve the format with it. 
Going all in on this. I feel it my waters.

Shout out to the redditor that told me about  Process Explorer , a better task manager that is part of the Microsoft System Internals package, written (or helped write??) by Mark Russinovich.  That also lead to me learning about a command line program wmic, which allowed me to lower the priority of the corporate virus scanner so it wouldn't slow down an important program on the same computer.

This seems like something that would have lived in the early meme days when rage comics ruled all. The top text bottom text reaction pics just don’t attract as many investors any more after several attempts to re-vitalize the market have failed. I don’t think this will get off the ground.
It's a label meme, but a more intelligent one. Could be versatile. Invested.

Meta but versatile, I could make this about anything. Also OP guaranteed a profit so I literally can't lose
GUARANTEED profit you say?
What even is this
Is? A picture? Can you explain why I should invest? 
Nooooope.
not sure about the versatility, however this got a hard nose exhale
but I wanna die..
What's with the text editing? Can't match the font size?
Wow I didn’t think boiler room would ever appear anywhere else 
Nice choice! Gonna have to watch some Blackadder this weekend.

Datsa meeeee
What? You're telling me you never saw this format before?
Same as the scroll of truth
Would invest, but the accusation is backed up by little scientific evidence. 
Very weak, high risk investment. 
This is has great potential
It has been posted. Several times. 
Can somebody translate pls
This is so hard to read.  I'll invest.  I love weird shit 
Wat?

Breaks rule 1 . Caution
This breaks rule one, deal with Caution investors.

u/IhrFrauen reupload this with correct title.
What are the other options for this meme? It seems more like you wanted to post this for upvotes rather than bring a new template to the market. Don't invest or upvote.
I invested everything into this, make me proud meme
It’s all in there boys. Do well...
Remember to upvote after investment! This ones going all the way
Totally a dry investment, will not invest 
This format is literally on the front page, we know it has high potential!! Go drop it on /r/dankmemes and rack in the karms instead, friend.
This was on hot yesterday.
I'm deleting the post don't invest. I don't go on hot so I didn't know it was on there.
Nope. The text is too long and too overwhelming to read, honestly facebook mum tier jokes. Try making the text smaller and deep frying/red eyeing the joker for it to appeal more, or it'll saturate fast.
Keep feeding

High potential and versatility! If only I hadn't squandered my fortune just now!
I would eat the shit out of that, but won’t invest
This isn’t even a meme.

Thought this was a meme not a story about my life. 
First post in this place and my head has fell off what is going on Pls help

This feels stale. I need LIFE in my memes 
See this is what this sub should be about. Not old/dead formats that  have already been milked. This sub is supposed to start memes not kill them even more by reposting other subs memes or even old formats from this sub itself and screaming BUY BUY BUY

Tried making one. It would seem it does have a certain amount of versatility, but I don’t see this format lasting very long, as it can easily become mundane all too quick.
I think I saw this several hours ago. Repost?
Breaks rule 1. Invest at your own risk
wEE
that arrow is purple.
Bad investment. Low versatility
Well don't mind me I just thought that said corpse salad
Reminiscent of those top/bottom text memes of the early 2011-2012 era, but I haven't seen the resurgence of those so avoid for now
Anyone have the format?
Looks promising, but cat stocks seem to be very sporadic so invest on this one carefully

After the explosion of this meme this morning, and now this rebuttal, I think we've got a direct hit captain!
I predict large returns on this one
As i learned from another kind fellow here, downvote before you invest to maximize profits!
I invested a ton, this better work out.

This was literally just posted
I don’t predict this to do too well in a neutrally-aligned forum
Sell, Sell, Sell! Just another label meme. And it's so cheap they had to white out parts.
This format had some popularity a couple months ago. While it could make a comeback and break into a new market, I'd be cautious.
If it weren't in 240p it would be worth a lot more
This is a worse looking version of an already existing (and now kind of dead) meme
This isn’t even a format or a meme.

Literally just a goofy picture.
Literally the first post before you
Y tf this thing still at 0 upvotes at 10 mins with 45 comments 
For 115 comments, I feel like this should have more upvotes.  Guys, if you left your downvote posted for others to invest low, don't forget to come back!
This, is amazing.
Take my upvote for originality.
Aaaaaaaand it’s a label meme
Come on man, this isn't a meme format it's a fucking manga. Do at least 2 minutes of research before posting

Accidentally posted to r/memeconomy. Much less active sub. 

Anyway, here's the template: https://imgur.com/gallery/7kOzj4C
An old template but it’s relatable enough to be a decent investment 
Not much potential. Maybe a little, but not much.
Seems to have very limited potential

Hello Newman. This is strong. 
I see Newman.  I invest
Very old but can be revived if done right
Disaprovement memes that make ones goals seem inferior are on the rise.  Let this one work for you.  I see much potential here for many acheivments to be made lesser. Some examples: Playing 4 years of varsity sports, getting some tiddy pics on your phone, finding out your preist touched you, and these are just a few possabilities.
Betting my bottom dollar on it. Don't let me down, Newman.  gt;!I know you won't! lt;

How would this be used?

How did you post this if you have already deleted reddit ?
I see a lot of versatility on this one. 
YOU STOLE MY FORMAT
Big returns on this one. Lots of versatility with the amount of shitposting on Reddit  
This is pure gold, tons of potential, but can't invest, everything's tied up in war memes!

Take my upvote!
Could be expanded to other apps too. Tumblr probably has alot of material.
Reminds me a lot of the very popular  How to delete someone else's tweet 

Since its now Reddit, I think it will fare slightly better.
This format has been on Twitter for at least 3 or 4 years. Yikes. 
This actually just fucked me up
Wait. How do they know what color dinosaurs were.
Eww iPhone
But how would Mormon Jesus feel?
This might surprise new brokers, but this versatile meme hasn't seen it's full potential yet, despite previous popularity!
I’ll give it a shot

Blowing up so fast!  I'm leaving my downvote posted for half hour to an hour for y'all!

Edit: We struck gold boys

Can this format be extended beyond task manager? I see a problem with low versatility here. Ride the bubble while you can, but I'm jumping the boat after this post.
To any aspiring memester who has an idea for a 5th panel on this:  Please wait 5 hours before posting to avoid cramps. 
You could take it even further and add an anti aircraft gun or something of the sort

I'm gonna put my downvote back down for about 5 minutes.  I think this is promising but it's gotten upvoted too fast. 
The faces are exceptional.  It's a nice use of it and I can see plenty of application.  There's also the possibility of copy/pasting faces of politicians etc which is a nice touch--you could even do a textless version with just that depending on the context.
Incredible versatility and it spits truth.

Sorry, dude. I know you're the one who created the meme (based on the water mark), but others have already stolen your karma from this sub. This is the fourth time it has been posted in the last hour or so. At least you can relish the fact that your meme has a following?

Could go far. All in with 300 billion. Please don’t let me down

When are all these investors going to upvote?1?

oh sheet Jerry brown fucked us with the gender neutral bathrooms, but to the ol penis inspection before McDonalds  
I remember something similar to this a while back. I would invest cautiously. 
“Ya I love putting ketchup on my watermelon”

“**S E V E R A L  P E O P L E  A R E  T Y P I N G . . .**”
Remember 8 months ago when all the big label memes were “me/weird memes/people i just met” with either the bowling guy or the orchestra percussionist using the big hammer? This is just those memes again.
If you do this, fuck you. One guy does this all the time and basically killed the chat group. Every conversation is ruines by it.
This is just a fucking repost
This went big a while ago, It's already been and gone, not worth investing anything. Is it just me or am I seeing more and more reposts on here?
Self deprecation memes are always hot.
Yeah I’d advise caution this ones been around the block
can we please stop with the label memes oh my gooooosshhh
Invest wisely for what should be a big, yet volatile, return. 
so I'm not the only one.
Everyone invest everything 
10/10, would invest if it didn't break rule #1
If it doesn't show comedy at immediate eye sight, its usually a horrible investment.

Now, about the content. Are there really that many people that don't realize that you can *disable the trending post notifications*?!? I disabled them like a week after I downloaded the app and I haven't any problems since, but I constantly see people complain about how annoying they are. Am I missing something here? 
gotta be wary with this one but seens nice
Not too bad, I'll give it a whirl.

New, and I think the versatility of this is limitless. Nice!
That bot makes me think I'm in over my head, and you aren't just a community of people who are just great at making memes. For what it's worth, this is my own picture, it was taken through a windshield of a moving car near Meta, Kentucky. It's not fake, but I did  fix  a big bug splatter on the windshield blocking the bottom right of the sign. I have a pic of the opposite sign when I passed it heading South, as well lol. 
Format is promising! You can replace the text and image and face and may be very flexible. I am all in.
This looks OC. Is this a dead investment? Nope!  I'm dropping a couple trill on this.

I’m afraid this is quite an old template already, and it’s been used a lot
Absolutely not.

Did you just get done buying a sword from the mall?
In what way can this be used? It's just a pic of a dude 
I fail to see what the uses are
I mean, he supports the boys in white but what else? It’s not a meme
It's too bad this isn't taking off more, I actually see some promise in this format

This should be doing so much better. We're smarter than this. What are we waiting for? Deploy the upvotes?
I have invested in every single one of these that I could so far (except the first one and the ones that came out while my funds were tied up) and it's making me a killing!
Hold the power button is god 
And then tasering it if that doesn’t work
Also can anyone put some little hats on these guys? Like a MAGA one and Bernie one?
A couple thoughts:

1) Do you really know Bernie supporters that either think all news is fake or just believe everything they hear? I haven't heard that stereotype, and I'm honestly not even sure why you lumped Trump and Bernie supporters together considering their polar opposite views. Guess that's all opinion based stuff, but adds up to a no from me.

2) Bottom right corner--watermark interferes with the text.

3) There are tons of websites and apps with various photo editing abilities, and putting a hat on them is super easy. Might be worth learning how to do some of that if you're gonna make memes?

Overall I think it's a solid concept and the punchline is pretty versatile, but personally I dislike this execution
What do you guys think? Does this have potential?
Funny, but not versitile
Maybe not, this ones really out there. But ill invest 100 and wish you the best on your entry sir. May you turn the tides in your favor!

Hi I'm a muslim. Can confirm, the west doesn't get us, we only want to live in pineapples but they wont let us.
This format is old, the meme itself has been reposted thousands of time on facebook, don't waste your coins
As a major stockholder of these type of memes, I see it has a very limited marketability. It would only take off in certain parts of the meme market.
Memri memes is soooooo Early-2018
This has convinced me to become a Muslim 
Nope do not invest. This meme is hella old and they didn't even change the original text. 
Suprisingly high number of upvotes in relation to comments.  Interesting.

Great. Another anxiety/depression meme...
Depression memes can pay out profits but since is yet another label meme watch out for the net loss it might cause
It's already made its way onto Facebook and Instagram, might be a goner. 
Yes guys this meme will drag the r/memeEconomy from all the losses from earlier this day. Just like the meme implies. This is a meta.

As much as people are sick of label memes this particular template could do well in the sports community (when a player carries his inferior teammates or something)

And just like in real life, the starting is only the beginning... Trying to *stop* is when the real nightmare happens.
That's actually thought provoking picture! He's struggling with a load he cannot carry, why? He could just let it go. But of course he thinks he absolutely needs to carry that load, he's afraid to let go because he thinks he'll lose something. Although only thing he'd actually lose is the burden.
Can someone provide the meme format?
I really need just the original picture without the labels

Why would you invest in this? There are three likely types of users to vote here.

1) Investors wanting to profit. Upvote.
2) Scrollers who downvote in order to wreck investments. Downvote (and loss of the entire  relatable  crowd).
3) Scrollers who normally upvote. Downvote (due to the whole d-bag factor)

Unless investors massively surge, this meme is going down in flames.

Even if they did surge though, this would become a bubble (an actual market bubble), where the market booms based off of investor movement, not backed by real support. The people who invest prior to or at the height of the surge lose everything. And that's assuming it would surge.

Whoa
“In our modern free-spoken society
There is a word that we still hold taboo
A word with a terrible history
Of being used to abuse, oppress and subdue
Just six seemingly harmless letters
Arranged in a way that will form a word
With more power than the pieces of metal
That are forged to make swords

“A couple of Gs, an R and an E, an I and an N
Just six little letters all jumbled together
Have caused damage that we may never mend
And it's important that we all respect
That if these people should happen to choose
To reclaim the word as their own
It doesn't meant the rest of you have a right to it's use”

Hot! 
There are ads on Netflix?
**UPDATE/FAQ: ARE THEY PUTTING ADS ON NETFLIX? PROBABLY.**

It’s something you can opt out of (for now), but they’re doing the whole thing I mentioned above more than likely as a means to have an excuse to do it.

They’re going by how people interact w the ads, not how many complain about it.

“Oh so many people are interacting with this, it must mean that the general population doesn’t mind.”

While at the same time, they flat out said that complaints against the ads would be ignored, so they can go by that instead.

TL;DR: They wanna, and from the deceptive manners they use, they’re sure as hell trying to.

most of them aren´t credible + most people don´t want the celebrities to get that treatment but a small number of outraged people make everyone think that something must be done or a product won´t sell. Trump on the other hand has made it part of his character as the only  proven  sexual misconduct was the grab them by the pussy which was consensual and simply re established Trump as a figure that got what he wanted and everyone let him do that.

According to CIA briefs of the time. Showed more Soviet citizens had higher caloric intake then American citizen.

Right up until the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Although the stats were based off of the Soviet published numbers. Which apparently didn't consider people X distance from a city. But those Urban Soviets eat better than Urban Americans. While rural Americans were getting fat as fuck on sugar.

What. Is. This
Wow
It had a high number of initial upvotes, so there was less risk, so you get rewarded less.
So the system goes like, the later you invest, the less you make. If you invest at 1000 upvotes your max potential growth is like 100x smaller than at 1 upvote
You might want to give the paper on memes.market a read, it features an in-depth explanation of how the system works
Because you only invested 200. Invest more to get higher percentage returns 
Same as the “oh no, it’s retarded” meme?

I'm glad she did. 

Come at me.
Is there a blank template for those that lack editing skills? Asking for a friend. 
I see potential. It will be modified and circulated and  for a while. Hit it and quit it stock, do not portfolio it.
Still waiting Randy...
should be half life 3
Man I wish somebody could go back in time to scrap Battleborn and just have had them focus on Borderlands 3...
I've seen this format live and die months ago. Sorry but for those reasons Im out 
Maybe I should give Borderlands 2 another shot... 
A LOT OF PEOPLE BEEN ASKING ME WHY MY VOICE BEEPS ALL THE F*CKIN TIME. THE TORGUE SHAREHOLDERS WIRED MY VOICEBOX WITH A DIGITAL CENSOR SO I CAN'T SAY STUFF LIKE SH*T, C*CK, OR P*SSY F*CKIN' D*CKBALLS! THATS HALF MY F*CKIN' VOCABULARY, IT'S GODDAMN BULLSH*T!

Now this I can get behind. 
Looks like he’s getting ready to do what I do when I play video games.  Get so mad I’ll shit a chicken.
this format is pretty old tho..
Been and gone. However some old memes seem to be making a comeback, invest carefully.
I feel like HL3 was a better fit
This man better stand the fuck up
Nice format will invest
Never Forget: Aliens Colonial Marines
Isn't this the same meme as the one with the guy looking at some girl while his GF is all ಠ_ಠ at him?  amp; I know that's a rehashed meme too. Y'all are more creative than hollywoo, come on make something new
Borderlands is eh honestly.
I can’t tell which is more important though
Meme prospectors are always looking for gold but this guy found a fucking fossil so I think he’s in better shape.

Just an FYI, I see you keep posting reposts of normie memes with no real r/MemeEconomy value. That's not what this sub is about.
Why do we need more scroll of truth, sword of truth, ed edd and eddy fact memes?

I’ll leave that to y’all. But tbh I don’t want no comparisons I’m a different breed. 
YOU FORGOT TO TAKE THE PAINKILLER !!!!!!
I don't really understand. Explain what's going on in this meme?
Normie trash 
Just a meme, not a format
I think this mean is sticking too much to the comics to be popular
Somewhat funny image, but terrible reusability imo. I’d say pass
Don't invest, this is a repost folkz!

Gas furries
Thanks for not screaming at me to buy i hate that personally 
Buy
That video is kinda interesting but still a #load of ballony
You know, as a furry myself, it kinda saddens me that the whole grouping of people is given such a bad rep. I mean, yeah there are awful furries and really cringy ones too, but I've met some of my closest friends and just some really nice people who are also furries as well. I mean, it's still a funny meme, though, no need tot hink about it all too much.
This was in my recommended and it was the worst video I have ever seen.
I dont understand
Nah. 
I'm confused on how this is a new format.

meme so old it has an instagram watermark
Needs a bigger watermark 
Old ass format, would not invest
“New format”
This meme isn't new at all. You can clearly see the Instagram repost watermark, which should be an indication to stop investing.
I wanna upvote the meme but the format is older than my dead gramma
and the guy at the top right is that old guy that just doesnt give a shit because hes too old to care anymore.

Thanks Kanye very cool!
Does this mean she didn't get me pregnant?
That headphone blasting on max volume is fucking cruel though
ITT: Bunch of people arguing about squirting.
Great. I am just peeing myself then. 
This is the scroll of truth meme.
My gf squirts routinely. It's always clear, then when she pees 10 minutes later it is always yellow, but whether or not it is pee really doesn't matter to me. Because the possibility of pleasuring her to the point of losing control of her bladder is incredibly sexy, just as sexy as the possibility of it being some mystery fluid. 
Fuck off this meme is years old 
Happy that Keanu is doing well!

This format is old, its been around already wtf is with you normies stealing old formats and yelling INVEST

My high school girlfriend used to squirt. It was before the internet and I'm positive neither of us had ever seen a porn film. Yes, it is a thing.
So you're saying I drank PISS?!?? 
So the scroll of truth meme?
That’s why it is always so warm and piss smelling

You post this, which is funny and in no way shape or form racist imo, but then you go and call someone racist cause they post a joke about black women being loud. I just don’t think that’s fair tbh
Too risky for an investment currently, but you have my upvote.
I'm investing very versatile if you change the word letter 
I love the versatility on this one! Could be great for self depreciation 
 Hot! 
Jazz music stops, hereforth JMS, is a format made popular in the early months of the year 2018. The format consists of a painting of a man playing what appears to be a bass. The general idea of the template is that the caption,  Jazz Music Stops' occurs whenever something happens that should not. JMS has presumably already had it's full run, topping off as one of the memes of the month in February. My personal opinion: 5/10, would not invest heavily. 
Rule #1. They’ve kindly put a rules link when you try to post here now. 
Can you not?

Oof I had faith in this meme
I kinda want to know what the original was. 
1.9B going in hard investors assemble. We’ve got work to do
I thought this was already a popular well known format 
Months old, just rose to popularity again briefly. Don't recommend investing.
My biggest investment yet, look forward to profiting soon! 
Dude nobody fukin upvotes when they invest I should be making serious profits but nobody on this subreddit gives a shit 
Spoiler alert..
This has been around for ages, wouldn't recommend investing.
This is refreshing. Let’s send it to the Hot page 
Now this is a quality meme! Edgy and topical, easily changeable. High investments ahead
Investment confirmed - see you at the top! 
Seems solid
They now post the rules right in the submission window when posting to this sub! Check out Rule #1.

It's got the ifunny mark of shame. That alone should keep any investors away. Plus, it's just another template for the same old meme.

Honestly, this one has been beaten to death. Do not buy!
If everybody sorted by new then whats the point of main page or top posts because no one will see them at there .

Logically misleading, i wanted to margin sell this.

As I tell everyone, this is not a meme and not a meme template. This is a picture. For this to be a meme you need to make it a label meme, add a place to add something funny or add additional photos with it and give an example. 

Then as you post the example you can link a copy of the original or blank template in your first comment. Then it warrants investment. But what you posted is not a meme and does not belong on this sub. 

Do not invest 
You don't need all that math to explain why EA BAD though!

Pot doesn’t make you that stupid. 
I smoke a lot of weed, but I also like not having polio.  So I definitely vaccinate.
That’s not how “pot” works. 
even pot smokers know to vaccinate
As a pot smoker I take offence to this lmao 
Pls don't associate us with those anti vaccination idiots 
Autism causes vaccines
What kind of a meme is this
Imagine the world if pot made you think vaccines were unsafe
Comfortable all in here 
Pot smokers aren’t that dumb. 
And can I have some
God damn how do you all have so many memecoins?
It will die in a week
you mean how much vaccine you took
You don't have to worry about vaccines if you already have autism.
As a pot smoker this offends me. 
As a pothead, I'm insulted that people think we become this stupid while high.
I would NEVER give my kids vaccine shots. I'll just let their doctor do it.

Lemme just tell you that I have smoked so much fucking weed and I have never once thought vaccines cause autism.

I do think theres some correlation between sonic games and autism however .
I don’t smoke pot 
I got 2 whole vaccinations and then  my adult onset autism  fully bloomed
Enough pot that could cause me to get AutISm.
Even the druggies are smart enough to vaccinate, I predict this meme will drop quick in the market. Investors beware. 
At least it isn's a label meme
Thinking pot makes you as stupid as an anti-vaxxer is as stupid as thinking vaccines cause autism.
Hey now, I may smoke pot but I’m not delusional 
Just enough.
Hey, welcome r/All
As someone who smokes pot, I'm offended.
Office memes are always worth it.
sorry.. too cliche
Don't fucking blame the weed for someone being stupid.


Sell, sell, sell!!!!
How are The Office templates looking right now? Jim and Michael reactions seem applicable to many things so I may invest a little to start.
That’s not how drugs work
Shitty meme. Not an organic post definitely been inflated with upvotesfor propaganda purposes. All Hail Vaccines all hail science. Hail to the high priest gender neutral Bill Nye.

Don’t try to get pot into this. Pot doesn’t make you distrust vaccines, people who’re stupid distrusts all types of vaccines and will die of the measles. 
Don't equate stupid with smoking pot. There are a lot of very smart people who smoke pot. 

Besides, we stoners need vaccinating due to getting the munchies and eating the stuff in the fridge that may or may not have been in there long enough to go bad.
r/nothowdrugswork
so sick of reddit shitting on the  gt;1% of dimwits who still think vaccines are linked with autism. Every day there's a new post. Its as if they think like half the world still believes this and its an  unpopular opinion . You're not smarter than everyone else by posting this shit every day.
Wtf? Sell sell sell
That guy must of took a lot of vaccines to be that stupid to think that

Yo guys can people remember to upvote after investment please
This belongs to the grand army of r/prequelmemes
Tepmlate/source, please?
would be nice if it were cropped, great meme nevertheless
The image is too small, but the concept is versatile. Try reuploading with the same text format but a more standard sized image.
How do people think this is new
Just another caption on an old template. I'm staying clear off this one
Staying off this one
Lmao this is my image mods just killed it yesterday 
Not funny really, beware
You worked hard on this one, didn’t you?
Forced humor is bad humor
Forgot to label the diaper as Facebook
Reddit feeds 9gag
As a regular user of the last two websites I feel that 8chan has no place in meme origin. In my time as a user of 8chan, I found no memes that bled over into 4chan. However, I do believe that 4chan has a large influence on reddit.
Tldr take an upvote
https://imgur.com/Pw6jBEw.jpg
What is 8chan? Or is this a joke?
Excellent use of a label meme. Investing heavy on this. 
8chan is petty shitty now, its worse than 4chan now. Also 8chan doesn’t have memes feeding 4chan.
I think itd be more accurate to have 2ch as the oldest man in this picture so I'm gonna hold off on my investment 
In for 10q
Easiest all in. 
Template plz??
INVEST IT ALL, THIS IS THE ONE
Bucky Barnes, Jon Stewart and the six flag mascot
Didn’t that guy host destroy build destroy on Cartoon Network when they were going through that weird live action phase?
Reddit feeds itself, which then feeds itself again until we have an endless repost cycle
What is 8chan? Do I want to know? 
Ages of people are in descending, but titles are not in order. My autism is very much triggered at this point by this mess.
!remindme 30 minutes
3 men and a babby
Copy of puppet controlling puppet meme
Forgot iFunny and Facebook 
8chan is still a thing? Does hotwheels still run it?
Its funny that people think 8chan is still active
8chan has actual child porn
9GAG is the diaper on the baby
Is this just a reskin of the puppet master meme?
I didn't know what 8 Chan was until I went on it I feel like shit now
This is it boys. It's like printing free memecoins!
FYI: 8chan does not exist on its own - it's a deep-cover op by the ebaumsworld.
What about 2chan?
do not invest, it’s just another label meme
There's a 8chan?

It has been posted on this same subreddit atleast 3rd time today
#Would you please start upvoting not just investing?    
    
That's it... You've played yourselves 
How many times have you seen your dads balls?
It always trips me up on this subreddit how a post can have 75 upvotes but over 200 comments.
I'm not sure if this will be profitable but I love it abs it deserves love and upvotes. 
Be safe on this one bois, for the night is dark and full of terrors
Decent meme. All in
But Facebook is main me me page 
This could be great, people are undervaluing its potential. BUY
It’s like a food pyramid
Ifunny isnt THAT shitty. Maybe the features can be bad but there are plenty of diamonds in the rough
IS the title english?
In what way is this versatile
Memeeconomy is really going downhill
Post this meme to the cover of Poof 
I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies. 
I would invest but your title increase the odds of the post being deleted.
Remove - title violation
The fuck is this
comment and upvote after you invest for maximum profits boys!
EA BAD GIVE UPDOOTS
EA bashing is always a safe investment!
I'm broke, hopefully this will give me something
Unachievable
Meme is quite old, but not used enough. Invest but dont expect huge gains.
If i lose my moneys ill never be able to invest again
Actually SWBFII has deleted all the paid content and all you can buy now are skins so game now exists
Sorry didnt see the first frame well when I made my last comment. Not sure this one will take off though
old format do not buy
Why the Impact font and strange editing?

Not a bad template otherwise.
Good meme.
To the front page! 
I did not know it was even possible to only have 2 tabs

It’s just the Trojan Horse meme but different. Don’t invest.
You forgot people who upvote, invest, and then downvote

2 more upvotes until profit. Let's go baby I was all in.
Could be huge. Invest!

Joseph Stalin: Food? Where we’re going we don’t need... f o o d...
Okay but how is it a format
So how can this be used other than what it was already used for? Stupid investment
Take my 30 quadrillion as a generous donation to the motherland.
I feel like Im gonna make a fortune!
But since the time machine wouldn’t exist without capitalism he might undo the existence of the time machine undoing whatever he did to save communism starting a loop that never ends
When you try to start your car but it just keeps Stalin. 
I've got a good feeling about this.
Everyone loves communism! Big things coming here.
Oh shit this is good.
Back to the October Revolution
I've invested all my savings into this as the motherland calls for my aid, and as I have invested once in the rise of the Union I shall invest forevermore 
This sounds like...wait this is totally communist propaganda and I like it, purchasing for 20 soldiers 
Makes me think of Red Alert 3 and how the new C amp;C game’s a mobile app. Too painful for me to invest.
wow nice repost from r/dankmemes
Stalin is one stripe away from wearing Adidas pants
It's funny because communism has about as much chance to work as that car does to go back in time

Is this a meme or a police training poster?

The meme has been beaten to death.
Yeah don't invest this is old
Template pls?
This format is not new
Even for r/reposteconomy this is old. Ancient in fact. 
This was funnier in my head, but I spent like five minutes making it, so I feel obligated to post it. 
You should have just left a blank space instead of writing popular thing
I see you learned from SEGA too.
I'm in for 30 billion. Pray for me.
This is *Elmo's* world, fool!
Great meme! I downvoted it for ya

I voted up.
Just wanted you to know I like your meme, I'm a busy person though and didn't have time to upvoted it.

Cheers!
I *dare* you, try and tickle me *one more time*!

How would you know they like it without them upvoting it in the first place?
It would be better if he wasn’t looking at the wall but still a meta format
Examples perform much better than templates here

Do remember, Don't Upvote upside down 
Hi everyone this meme seems to have legit true potential. I am aiming for the Q. LETS DRINK IT IN
I’ll keep the score low for y’all 
I think this is a shit meme. Invested 100mil bc what has my life come to? Investing fake currency on memes i dont like so i can have more fake currency. This is the peak of human existence. Alexa play the State Anthem of the Russian Federation. 
Delete the other post imo. 
Not versatile enough for big investments
Piss or squirt, for real that shit delicious no matter what
This is a repost...
Just the scroll of truth and hard to swallow pills meme format but a different pic 
Investing cuz a zillionaire invested .
Be bleach? 
There’s an incorrect spelling, I don’t see this going far
Now this is a meme I’ve seen at least 100 times before!
How is this a meme format
oi vei
If the third panel is blank then yes, maybe. 
I’ll give it a go
Yea definitely just needs a master craftsmen to perfect it
Fortnite hate and reddit, a perfect combination!
I'll make one with this and see how goes. While it is pretty similar to a lot of other formats, this is often the case with memes. Take ligma, sugondese and updog for example. So I'm in the middle for if it will be successful or not. 
Another me-3am-my meat format..
Infinity War memes are big rn, invested 250 Billion as highly versatile! 
This meme has the potential for as many labels as you want! I’m investing 
Def investing on this one, the potential is very high
This shit is the shit
Damn this is gonna make us rich 
Big money here, more to be made.
I read that they used somebody's son for that picture because the director thought it was too mean to use a girl.
Home alone memes on the rise
What Barbie movie is that from?
I hope people invest in this meme and it dying and investors losing money so i can make a follow up meme on this
This format is very similar to other ones, such as the wheelchair girl. However I expect decent returns because the market is saturated with shit memes. Invested.
Went all in. Daddy needs a new pair of shoes!
Interesting item, but didn’t they only make one Matrix film and stop it there?
Isn't this just the lost scroll meme but he throws his friend instead? 
Oh boy, r/trebuchetmemes and r/catapultmemes would sure have a field day with this. Could probably even change up the last panel and have one for r/garlicbreadmemes where he doesn't push him.

If I had any memecoins left I would invest :(

This is a well establish meme that’s basically run its course. Sorry, but not a worthwhile investment 
Easy investment to make.  Great meme 
Where we droppy boys? 
Ironic considering we are memecapitalists! I like it. ALL IN.
Great format but font could be more legible
Reposters like you make me regret sorting by new 
Get in quick. This format is versatile and this meme is current.
I think there’s a little too much going on. To many blank panels. Could see some use on r/inthesoulstone or r/thanosdidnothingwrong, but only top-tier thanos memes ever make it out of there. 
If anyone wants a template here's the link

It's a little blurry so you might be better off making the same template in Photoshop since I'm very limited on mobile. If you do, please feel free to share it down in the comments if its better than mine.
Cat memes are adorable! Buy buy buy!
Old format + crosspost from r/BikiniBottomTwitter = risky but average for current state of the sub. I'm torn

Isnt this just a label meme with the rain labeled‽ 
I remember watching this live on periscope. Team blue shed!
Irma!!!!!!!! 
The format would be better without impact font and if I could actually read it.
Why are the downvotes red and the upvotes green?
Me when I talk shit about Fortnite 
it looks like its raining upvotes... you know that right?
label memes are the future
That's MC Ride right?
Where's the source material without any upvote/downvote edits?
The power of christ compels you !
This is overwhelmimgly clever.
All in. All of it.
It should be a downvote in a storm of upvotes
This is like, really old. And therefore a repost.
Meta but isn’t this just another version of the small man vs big monster label meme and it’s iterations that plagued this sub for months?
I actually love this 
Please upload without label

You posted it too soon. The original has taken all the upvotes 
Probably huge since the more obscure your gender the more likely you are to use you use gofundme to monetize your oppression.

Statistician here: not enough data on most genders. 
I like it but i doubt I'd profit
Imagine reposting one of the highest upvoted formats from yesterday WHILE breaking rule 1!

Really poor trigger control there
Fresh format. I’m buying
New format seems decent 
I feel like the anti capitalist theme goes against the, uh, locale of where you’ve come for a valuation. But you do have to break a few eggs to make a revolution. 
Low effort format, but seems risky. Quality could bd greatly improved my matching the font with the original

All these investors and only 4 upvotes. Smh 
Is this format new? I haven't seen it before and I see lots of versatility here, just not sure if it's because I'm living under a rock lol
I don't care if the people who created the format pronounce it  jiff  they're simply just wrong. 
3/10 quality. Also the arrows are distracting and not necessary. Pass on this one.

Needs more JPEG.
What’s your solution?

Just upvote the damn thing 10 more times please!!

I like where this meme is going. Next up is roblox/fortnite players I suspect.
Is it just me or is this a repost?
Holy fuck, this meme is ancient. Like this is a 2010 level memes.
This has huge..... 
Advantages: Relatable, appealing to core meme consumer demographics (horny teenagers)
Disadvantages: Label meme

Verdict: This format has massive potential
24 UP in 5 mins, 30 investments, this is going to the top
Oof lots of big money in this one already
So relatable
Jesus christ, 30 upvotes in 8 mins, i hope im not too late.

My man. You’ve been here a lot today. My fellow investors and I usually tie up all of our coins for 4 hours at a time. It might be best to space out your content a little bit, so investors have the chance to get some coin back and invest in your next post. You obviously can do whatever the hell you want, but you might get some more bites if you don’t blow all of your dank memes here in a week.

Good meme, I see potential 
This is a repost from Instagram. It has a tank Sinatra watermark 
Wtf are those baby hands
This post reallllyyyyy makes me want to end my life
No, there is risk involved in investments
Has this subreddit always been just one natural disaster away from meme-socialism? As a more-fortunate investor without any active investments at the the time I must advocate in the conscience of my memecoin holdings against the mods taking any measures so that the losses may stand as they are. I cannot have my meme-portfolio devalued by the inflation from handouts. 
I feel attacked. 
This seems pretty versatile
Sorry for those 3 duplicate posts, internet fucked up. Deleted now.
Label memes are everywhere. Will not invest. Also due to the nsfw aspect it wont attract as many investors. 
Buy. Simple, no labels, and even though the implied meaning is nsfw, the meme itself is. 
I’m not feeling it- any opinions?
This meme is actually older than the Mario meme
Repost this.  It deserves more light

There are 26 watermarks why would you invest?
Its almost r/youdontsurf ...but still laughed at the midget part.  

Dear FBI...I cannot relate to this meme.
this looks like a screenshot from a porno. is this a screenshot from a porno?
Only the brave FBI agents can watch this
This is so fucking old, the format aint new and the content in it aint new

Plz upvote my comment
Smells like potential to me!
In my opinion its just flooded with bad memes... i think you should have to have a certain amount of memecoins before you can share posts, because comment karma alone is not strict enough
Another idea i had was to create a post it would cost like 10000 memecoins but you got back a profit depending on the upvotes
I'll be honest, I've tried to post like 2 new formats, and they didn't go over well, but I'm from the 2012-14 Facebook meme era, so my taste prolly doesn't align with most Reddit users, and I'm gonna stop trying until I'm sure I have

 gt; Meme Economy is where memes are made and where trends are defined. Due to the nature of the subreddit -- fast paced and highly active -- memes are brought here to debut and have their veracity and efficacy tested. Given the unique nature that is the trading done on memes within this subreddit, with a direct correlation between great returns on investment and popularity in the real world, visitors to the subreddit are engaged in testing themselves as they hone their abilities to identify the next big meme and stand at the forefront of a viral phenomenon. 

However I'd say, it's just a subreddit where I come when I'm bored and wanna piss away my virtual money.
Stale hah. See what you did there

Get the low fat one, it’s less gay.
Cool investment
The frog needs more gay.
Label meme about a joke from years ago... invest very very cautiously 
With improved quality it's gonna be gold. Going to invest a little
Going all in, come here for your pointless morning meme investment!
Is that a fortnite character getting nutted on? 
This could work. I like it.
But at this hour... will it be noticed?
It's like you don't even trouble yourself to look at the front page.  Every day there are at least 3 posts that reach over 10-15k votes. 
And every other day a post reaches 35-50k. Just because the content trending is not appealing to everyone, doesn't mean the system doesn't work. It clearly works... and the perspectives on the subject vary. The most consistent investors stop participating when they reach 1Q. There are always new seasons and new members. This sub won't die for a long time. 
I feel like we just need to stop upvoting stale memes. It seems like the new stuff, the stuff that should be going up is getting pushed down by stale reposts.
Old. Not versatile.

Big oof
You've become the very thing you sought to destroy
Now we just need that spiderman meme you know what i meen
Just to clear things up. The irony was intentional. That was the point of the joke
I feel like this has great flexibility for some fast laughs.
Straight in there like a rat up a drainpipe!

I would be careful since this post technical doesn't state anything about investing. I'm not investing strictly because it's a rule 1 violation
How is this a format??

I think there were layoffs because of automation before whenever this episode came out buddy 
Very cool kanye 
Seems forced
The only thing I noticed was that the guy filming had a fedora + trench coat combo shadow. Dunno how I picked that out. 
Meta memes are fairly safe these days 

Edit: self fulfilling prophecy. Damn...
Niche - Australian politics. Is also a youtube video so idk what format you're talking about.

Is it worth investing in average memes after 30+ min?

It’s early in the trading day, but I threw some coins behind this one. Hopefully it’ll pay off. 
I still don’t know how this sub works. I invested in like, two memes and nothing happened.
I believe in you, I'm in.
I lost 150 pounds after an accident.

...After decades of carrying extra weight, my legs were ripped underneath all the blubber.

My legs are insane, every muscle is hella defined, even my fibularis longus and anterior tibialis are defined from each other.

It's not just the weight loss, having my balance donked meant I wobble and sway all the time, this apparently is great for calf definition.
Take my life savings

No one has seemed to mention this yet, but this is a relatively old template. You can get memecoins on this post, but the market value is super low. It’s already had its rounds on all the main subs. It’s been in my portfolio for months 
Semi label meme
I only know how to invest big. Do not disappoint!
Been wanting to start. But how? Any advice guys?
Oh if only I'd gone all in instead of a paltry 150!

Hopefully this will make up for the millions of memecoins I lost yesterday due to the bullshit reddit outage. Literally lost like 4,000,000. I can’t imagine how the quadrillionaires and quintillionaires feel. 
What happened?

Stay away, it's a repost. Not just the format but the exact same words.

Gif memes always bring great investments. This will rise quick.  Solid investment.  
I have never seen a gif since joining this sub. INVEST
Not bad but this template can not be edited in Paint. I won't invest 
Nice repost

https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/8l3oed/houston_maymays/?st=JL4DT9U0 amp;sh=55f2097c
This has been reposted a handful of times. Each post is never successful.  
Why each spangebob-meme is on the rise?
Supreme isn’t overpriced, but it isn’t worth much to begin with and it’s room for growth is small. An investment in this will be trading pennies for pennies.
Mmmm no thanks. I feel like the payback is minimal on this
Just replace the hammer and sickel. You could put bionicles in. 
There has been marginal success with the label attack memes since they started and it’s only on the decline.

Can you call again guys the call got disconnected. Can someone pass this message along to the depot

This meme should have to pay people memecoin just to look at it.
The lack of an example may prove costly. Generic format but could be diversified sufficiently. Very versatile. You can literally add any image catering to the audience (specific subreddits.)
Who's that cute lesbian?
Usually I refrain from investing on example models, people often don't upvote them, but I see potential here and it's been slowly rising. Might be a bit late to the party, but I'm investing on this one!

I think it’s more than a reverse drake meme. The drake meme is “thing/better thing” while this is “thing/bad part of thing”. 

I definitely think it has potential. 
I like this one, I could see it going places. BUY!
Good format, worth investing people.
WHAT? AN ACTUALLY NEW MEME THAT IS ALSO A FORMAT AND NOT JUST A MEME THATS POSTED HERE FOR FREE KARMA?
I'd buy but my pockets ain't no deep yo.

This meme had it's potential maybe a year ago, now it's stale af.

This is so sad. Alexa play we are number one
 It's not until they tell you you're going to die soon that you realize how short life is. Time is the most valuable thing in life because it never comes back. And whether you spend it in the arms of a loved one or alone in a prison-cell, life is what you make of it. Dream big.  - Stefan Karl

Rest In Peace man.
Rest in peace, Stefan. 
He will always be number 1

UGH can we please stop with label memes? 
Stop this label meme madness
The example would have made sense if you replaced  Apples  with  Upvotes  or  Karma . The picture of the apple also poses an issue as replacing it with another picture would obstruct the entire text. Just adding a caption won't do it for a meme like this, and the picture of the apple takes all versatility away from the meme.
i can see the potential boiiis
It’s just scroll of truth

Old format, don’t buy
Even outside of the meme, he seemed like a really cool guy. He was so enthusiastic and joyful about bringing happiness to others.

He really was number one.
Wow this came really unexpected. I think this is the first passing (if not, one of the first) of a big member in our community. We've all had our quarrels, controversies and disagreements, but Robbie Rotten was a universally beloved figure by the whole community. He will be missed. He was number one. RIP.

It... really... be like that... sometimes... :(
Damn it... I bid you farewell, Mr. Rotten.

Wow, that's terrible. 
Always number one

I knew it was only a matter of time and yeah I know he got big because a meme but he turned out to be such a nice dude who really knew how to embrace the meme. Genuinely sad at his passing but I'm glad he isn't suffering anymore.

Robbie Rotten memes are going to be big for the next week. Rest In Peace to the man.
Damn.....
You either live a hero, or you die to see yourself become the villain number one.
This feels like it came out of nowhere. Like I know we all knew he had cancer and it wasn't going to end well, but it's been a long while since I've seen mention of him or the meme on reddit. I guess I took that to mean he was doing alright. I guess I was wrong :(

RIP Stefán. You will always be our number one
Alexa, play we are number one
Stefan Karl was not only a meme, he was not only the biggest meme lord of us all, he was a big part of my childhood. Lazy Town was just the single best tv show out there, it really shaped my sense of humour tbh and was just a fun show with Robbie Rotten being my secret favourite character cause he was the villain #1

Forever and always number 1
Rest in piece our meme overlord.
Haven't been on MeneEconomy in a while, but rushed here as soon as I heard. Tis a sad day indeed.

Very many subs honored him

He provided some voice work for some Ubisoft games and has had tributes in r/forhonor and r/shittyrainbow6 as well. 
you forgot animemes as a big one. sequelmemes is also doing it. and basically every subbreddit about memes and some others
Add in r/forhonor , he voiced some of the characters

Okay actually a great label meme haha
Template ?
My life is more interesting then I’d like lol
Nope. He can never be a meme. 
8 years later and Milhouse still isn't a meme
I’d never do that...
Remember to downvote invest then upvote
Rest in peace, Stefan
It's been reposted everywhere
F my dudes :/ help sign the petition
This is versatile. BUY
Very versatile, I have a good feeling about this.

Everyone liked this movie, everyone will get the reference, all in.
Ah I see u/DeathPro is exploring king fu panda 
Sadly  me when  formats are too normy to succeed the current market
We shouldn't be using a dead man as a form of investment-wait a minute we are essentially internet yuppies of course we are because we have no soul or sense of empathy for others as long as it benefits us!
This aint no meme
I would love there but this is a bad format, it’s just like everything else at this point.
He would have wanted him to save her no matter what here views and opinions were. 
Didn't you learn anything from Stefan? He taught us that all life is precious no matter of their opinion. 
He taught us how important life was. Stefan would’ve saved her no matter what. Remember how he taught us to *LOVE*.
Dude this template was being used like months ago
Maybe in peak hours
What if she downvoted?
Why would that be the first thing to say to a firefighter?
what is the point of this meme and how unique is it
There is a watermark, it's not you
It'd probably be more likely to happen if it were a Gofundme, and we, the people who demand the statue, are paying for it.
Done!
I've already signed, but every single person in this subreddit should.
Why though?

Who's paying for it?
So a low resolution repost?
Old template.
So basicly the scroll of truth and the facts meme again
the same goes for mlp and tiny rick icons
Not even if it’s a lewd one?
Fact: the universe will implode if you have an anime profile pic and like this image
I would never have an anime profile
the death note potato chip scene should be an exception
old template, remember 
Its meme economy, not r/memes
Wow, a scroll of truth meme!
Fight me
ITT: weebs
I invested in this meme a week ago and lost 25%
/r/gatekeeping
R/animemes thinks otherwise. Probably.
You didn’t even have to do the math to come to that conclusion LMAO
Makes sense to me 
Need template fam. 
theyre allowed to, they just dont matter though
How cool would it have been to sit by his bedside and show him all the memes he was apart of. Even the edgy ones fuck it.
That would go in the tv section of the brain, right?
The one and only Stefan

We're reposting from /r/funny now? How low have we fallen?
This is a fantastic meme with lots of possibilities. Retards here are complaining about the /r/funny repost, but it’s better than reposting from /r/dankmemes, or another shit label meme
Venn diagram is like prostitution. There has always been prostitution and there will always be prostitution. Ain't nothing new here
Gold star for my friend 
My favorite artist

Now it's art.
NO THIS IS PATRICK
Beware of rule 1
new, lol
What are you going to do next, join the deathclaw preservation society?
Haha... no
What cartoon is this?
yes the market has nothing to invest in
On a day this slow. Might as well
This is gonna go quick. Invest while you can
Very slow day and this is one of the only things I see as potential, starting to go really fast so invest as fast as you can because this is Simpsons and that equates to profits almost all the time
Only somewhat decent meme today, no choice but invest
I'm gonna need about 100 of you to upvote this in the next 20 minutes please.
10 mil... Fuck why did i go all in
Has this been posted to wholesome memes yet
A cleverly re-masked version of a previous post. Well done. It’s like when something has been posted before, and then somehow, some way, it gets posted again. I just can’t remember what they call that though... a redoing of something done once before. Re-did? Re-done? Renovated? I can’t remember. Oh well.
Simpsons meme in a recession? I’ll try it
fuck it i’ve got nothing to lose after shorting incredibles 2 meme
This’ll be big boys, OP always does quality memes. I would invest if I could 
Best post I’ve seen in hours here
Get in quick boys, it’s taking off
In for 4 billion at 0 upvotes. Hoping this breaks my unsuccessful investment streak
Invest quickly we need a market refresh!
Can a flood of Simpson’s memes turn the market?
What am I lookin at here
That doesn’t seem versatile 
Stefan memes are in a big one-day bubble that's about to pop and drive down the entire meme market.
I really hope the front page becomes loaded with Simpsons memes
Gonna be big, I can feel it 
This better be a big one for me
Close to 4 upvotes a minute, not bad for how new it is.
Early morning Homer can bring big returns.  I’m in
I only see one god
M E S S I A H 
What’s up with redditors reposting?
Hitler did that a lot too
Are you farting on your girlfriends pillow? I don't get it. 
Too much stuff. 
My critique is that it's too much info to get the meme. Great memes are always simple.  
Where this from?
Nope, sorry.
Screw it, all in

Well here's the investment we have been waiting for this morning.  This will steady rise today.  
If there's one thing you should be doing right now, it's investing big on this one
INVEST NOW. Big profits to be made
Very versatile. You could change out the bottom two panels with different reaction/reveal panels.  I see this taking off.
Invest boys, I have a hunch about this one.
Isn't this a scroll of truth meme?
A solid format
I don’t see the versatility here seems like a one trick pony. 
So damn pertinent to this sub...I'm all in
If your gonna steal a meme at least dont use such shit quality
Financially tied up but upboated for wholesomeness 
Always #1 in our hearts ❤
This is so damn wholesome.
Police officer: so why did you save her even though she didn't upvote the Stefan meme?

Fire fighter: Yeah I saved her because Stefan taught me life is precious and no one deserves to die. 
Karl wouldn’t want a woman to be injured in his name
I honestly think that only a monster can say things like that
Dang you reposted my post but changed it so that you saved her and got 3x the amount of upvotes I got
Morgan is that you
We've hit stage 3 of this memecow, pump her now while there's still a few drops of karma left
I hate to say it but there's little to no profit to be made with love and positivity, and there hasn't been since the 60s and 70s.
yeah i liked stefan and i'm sad he died but this is just lies
Fuk that bitch, shoulda let her die.

Big money, easy investment
I went all in. High effort meme. 
Kind reminder; downvote - gt; invest - gt; upvote
Would it be wise to bet against a billionaire?
To maximize profits: downvote, then invest , wait for reply , upvote CASH IN 
Breaks rule #1, will be removed
Miley cyrus so listened to all of them and stated  so I put my hands up  do you know you got that going for you
This isn't the place for this
Explain please
Kinda only works if you know the context (what the mirror does, what he actually sees, and that he is lying).
Good template, good investment.
This could be a Yiay episode
Isn't this just the Venn diagram? Investing anyway. 
cheeto is funny
Cheetos are in 
Im sorry investors. Someone left the cheetos bag open n they stale now
This is an old format though
Amazing. Posted on r/MemeEconomy, reposted to r/funny, reposted back to r/MemeEconomy. 
Seen this 3 times today 
This is a great meme.

Poor camera angle. I'd agree that a picture of the full sign would have better potential
Is there one of the whole sign? If so u can definitely remove/change it into something funny.

Oh no i have to put him down
Are we just throwing Rule #1 out the window today?
It’s just the spidermen meme again.

Don’t invest.
No its not
Went all in on this one. Oh the irony
Really feeling the c meme bc tickers uptop. Wud invest heavily if paired w the right format
Dankbob, if you get me 60 updoots, I’ll join the 1Q club.... you’re a true hero. 
This is an interesting format.

The tom and jerry format is best at YouTube memes, to be honest.
See you on the front page. 
Amazing format so much potential! Buy! 
I'll throw in some chips on this one!
0/10 meme
That's a reaction image, not a meme
It's been posted only 3 times (by same OP) this week, never took off. Keep your coins, fellas.
Low resolution. Motion blur. Terrible lighting. Garbage title. General low quality template. I urge you not to invest.
Rule 1 vio
But do it tho?
I need template ASAP
Remember to downvote - invest - upvote for maximum profit!
This is the one to end the dry spell.

I have invested
Scrolling past, maximum invest engaged
I'm a busy man
Mysteries that cannot be solved: this post gaining so much traction but imma invest anyways

First post I don't downvote before investing. You **can't** downvote the number one villain.
Please upvote lol

Another fucking repost? Posting the same format with different headings isn't a new format.

Why do people like him? He was just a stupid meme
Just what the market needs right now.  
As always, here's the blank: https://imgur.com/a/YuSoABC
I just don’t see the versatility here
I won't invest because I don't want to use him as profit but I will upvote as a sign of respect.
Invest in this meme. 
Checks all the boxes. Could be worth a fortune. 
I am for it. 
Wasnt this template already being passed around a couple years ago? '
This is going to be huge. Invest now!

EDIT: i went all in on this so i'm going to be super rich
I'm all in boys, and as a brand spanking new investor. May Stefan Karl Stefannson, RIP, lead me to the promised land!

I’m buying.
I'm invest all I don't care what I get back this meme deserves it
Investing out of respect
Stefan Karl is love, Stefan Karl is life. He was, is, and will always be in our hearts forever
invested my entire fortune of 1000 meme bucks to the cause
His last name is misspelled. It's Stefansson (Stefán Karl Stefánsson).
Please, Reddit. Make this the new popular format
Stefan Karl Steffanson has reached meme immortality. It is up to us to keep his light alive.
Stefan was a goddamn saint. I didn't get to watch LazyTown when I was a kid, but I definitely enjoyed the We are Number One meme. Stefan definitely seemed like a truly genuine human being and it's so sad to know that he's gone. He will be missed.
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!

Man if only I invested more @ 3 upvotes... still great investment
You got my vote!
Invested out of respect, rest in peace meme friend
Let’s make this a fucking thing. This way he can live on forever as a meme
Stefan Karl doesnt have a kid he's hiding from the world so I'm in
This is one of the first posts in a while on this subreddit that's actually been worth investing in! RIP Our Number One...
All in. Even if I go bankrupt this is going down in history.
15m all in. RIP #1
Drake did it better, and on top of that profiteering off of the dead is unethical business practice in my book. I stick to organic fair trade free range Drake tyvm
What better way to be immortalized than a meme?
You just unlocked a whole new fuckin level
I have no idea who he was and at this point I’m to afraid to ask. 
I like this more, but the drake meme is epic. I never enjoyed it. But would like this. It’s more fun. Drake is a real gangster.
Still no clue who this guy is
Dank.

Gold Jerry, G O L D !
Meme economy is where memes go to fucking die 
Drake's is way better
Am I the only guy who has no idea who TF this dude is? 

RIP tho.
Can we please stop with the posts about this dude. 
This not funny, a meme died, delete this
Get off his corpse already! Can't wait till next week when Reddit forgets about this guy and the process of course repeats when another celebrity dies.
This shit is so dumb
Now this... this is a wise investment. 
More
Invest level = MAXIMUMER
I stopped just lurking for this meme
Putting my entire bank into this one
This HAS to happen.
I love this. 
I invested everything (almost) and I don't care! 

This format is the future and I will fight for it. 
Thought of this last night. Great minds think alike. Definitely investing
Going through a tight spot, but I’ll go in on this for sure! Seeing a huge rate of return in the future!
Rip Robby rotten 
The man loved when people memed him. This is what he would have wanted. This is honouring the man even after death. He will always be #1.
This is going to be a group effort.
I just now learned that that was drake in the old format. 
Stefan Stefannson is like jim James or John Johnson fr
It’s *okay* if you’ve seen the movie, but it’s a bit confusing for people who don’t know what’s going on. No return on investment 
I already lost money on this meme earlier today investors beware!
Already lost money on this format. 
In for 75k. Let's do this.
all in 14 trillion
In for 7 million lets get this one to the top boyz
Guys chill its just a meme i poorly made
Big bucks here. Invest a lot until 100 upvotes, then your returns will fall. Big profits!!!
we have a lot of investment going on i see so lets ride this babe to the end
always upvote Big Smoke memes
IM ALL IN BOYS! Wish me luck! 
Woa this blew up
did you use an actual eraser
The format here is *really* the Drake Hot Line Bling meme. Reskins are always popular, but only for a limited audience. This is probably better than average, but it’s a novelty,  the Drake meme is established. 
This.... there is some truth to this
Are we just investing in comic strips now?
Dunno, that meme is dead
Nice. 9/10 Would invest 100%
When big companies try to use memes for marketing
Guys vote smal dad or long dad

When you find out who Stefan wanted to love everything and live life to the fullest
Whats rtx?

Id fire heavily if your title wasnt a rule 1 violation
Always use protection 
Oh shit we happy few just became real
Is my internet shit or did the bot not reply?
Damn OP.. i really liked this
That movie was great
This one's old. It already ran its course
Write Jake Paul and Haters on the last one. Reupload. I'd invest. Templates don't pay out as well as memes with templates in the comments. 

PS. I miss the old memeeconomy
I don’t have enough karma but some do Demi lovato and drugs
Stefan Karl is afraid of nothing.
I too am afraid of ⬛
Dont upvote till you get confirmation!
Man, I love Pink Floyd as all hell but I don't see the flexibility in this. I'll give it points for Robbie though! Not the greatest format, but a nice meme and album ❤
This is quality.
Template for Robbie Rotten meme?
i signed it yesterday and it had 130k signatures
Yes! 
I’m definitely doing this ASAP
FUCKING amazing 
You want my opinion? Check what i threw down.. Lets ride OP
Good template, let’s go to the top! 
See what?
It’s perfect in every way
Yeah those n word tapes... if they havent showed up before i doubt they will now
It is a label meme, but I think the circumstances may allow for a decent profit. I'm in.
Maybe it could be a “beating the dead horse” meme
I had honestly never even heard of this dude before yesterday, and now every other post is him. I think what drives me most nuts is how lazy people are being about it--most are just posting pictures of him that aren't memes *and* don't have economy-related titles. 
Flair meta
This is meta right here

Yes it doesn't work for me. Just curious what type of device you have I use a Samsung Galaxy S5?
There is soooo much potential but somehow I feel like this is a risky one
I feel like this meme needs another panel with what the phone says to survive in the market 
That’s cool, but how is it a format?
YOU *WHAT*
This dude is gas lighting
5B all in. I’ve felt the best and worst weather of this quarter and this, although from a well tested arena, has got the stem to go the the top.

it's an old format, but the meme is still worth an upvote
Definitely not a new format 
Salt water will not hydrate.
Karl not “Carl”

Even virgins can be comrades 
The market has gone cold the last few hours. 
240p why
Adding a small position here. 
I just hope this doesn’t get deleted like a lot of the others I invested in, already lost a lot of money today. This one has potential!
It’s not something I’d invest in. 
He's number 1. All in.

That’s outside the box thinking 
This is risky, imo. Join us memes have a corner on the recent RIP market. Would take a massive disruption to see profits with this new format.

Invest with caution 
Wholesome
Keeping my downvote for a few minutes. Get it will it’s cheap these are hot right now!
i too, am heavily invested
A little late but I’m all in nonetheless 
I is a very sad
Im giving my last memecoins for this wholesome meme!
Why not both 
Normally a great meme. The perfect pair, however right now reddit is dedicated to #1
we have to get it up to 350,710 so the number of signers is equal to the population of Iceland.
Why would you start a petition and not a go fund me for this? Who’s gonna pay for the statue?
Once it reaches a goal, the goal just gets bigger
##AlwaysNumberOne
I 100% support this notion. But if expirience has taught me something its that these petitions mever work

With better text placement it could become great. I will invest.

But wouldnt yourself be a whore?
From an investment viewpoint this makes sense but from a moral standpoint please don’t disrespect my boy like this.
The idea for those unclear:  When replying to a suspected bot, include the meme. See if they can do the captcha. 
This is a hot one. Versatile.  New. Sexy and thiccc. 
Don't forget the Downvote - Upvote Cycle 
Self depreciating and the product of our worst fears? Millenials will eat this up. INVEST NOW. 
This might get removed as it doesn't follow rule 1? : lt;
Why wasn't this invested in, is it a repost? This is pure gold if OC.

Damn i wish i couldve invested.
Oh god the recursion
It's a versatile format. For example, a small dickbutt expertly placed to the far right. 
I was there for the stefan post that made it to the front page. I see big potential in this one. Lets do it again boys! I went all in!
Oh snap

This is a repost. *DO NOT INVEST*
Nice try, but this is just another label meme. 

Save your investments for proper memes, guys.
I think everyone sees value
Remember to downvote now and upvote later. It’s the best strategy to maximize your own profits as well as your fellow Redditors’ profits!

Great remake on a classic get it while you can!
It would be better if u would make a sample meme while presenting a format
RIP to a legend 
Most of us are 20-40 men who know of this guy because of the Memes and our kids 
You were the type of dude to watch the history Channel when you were younger 
I'm 20 and saw lazy town as a kid what do you mean 
Idk who he is either. He looks kinda creepy in character.
In all seriousness guys, can we please bring normal memes back? I'm sure this dude touched plenty of hearts, and I don't mean any disrespect just because I wasn't familiar with him. But this sub isn't really designed to be a memorial, it's supposed to be for memes and investing.. 
Noice
Poor timing! I would invest if this were posted during USA daytime. I'm upvoting instead.
Don't kill your coins here.. repost
He was beyond anime. FFFFFFFFFFFFF.

Template OP I needs it.
Make sure to upvote after investing!
Don't invest, very few people use this retard unit.
No they don't have
I'd love to invest, but political memes don't typically seem to do well on this sub. Personally I love it though! 
Pull out game strong 
This literally comes up when you Google meme!
im crying its so bad

i love it
This is so sad.
Are you saying the bottom panels is the new meme
Do not replace top and profit
This is so sad i actually can't do this
Invest before this stock bursts.

Every sub I subscribe to get’s taken over, it’s quite a rush having that kind of power
My boi gus over there 
Youre quite late if you think this is a new format. 
I agree but... this is disturbing for me which is strangely a surprise.
This is disturbing
WTF
i love how he has many normal teeth in the first picture but only has 2 left in the last one
I hate this
We all know it's halo wars...
Did you just repost something from r/comedyheaven? 
Speak a bit more my language. Be more blunt and try to make it idk a little more clear with who’s who.,
This is not what Stefan would have wanted
This is similar to Mario Brothers meme but I see it blowing up
Very creative
You have like no battery power
Worth the invest. BUY
Buy from me
I don’t see at all how this is versatile. All you can change is the end of Siri’s last sentence. I’m not investing
What are you talking about? This isn't versatile at all! What would I be able to change?
You're wonderful.
Sorry, I’m an apple guy. I won’t invest.
can't see much to do with this, not very versatile at all
If you want the template google white. I really need some water.
You have the best laugh.
You are enough.

I love IASIP but this isn't a meme
No, no it will not
I swear everyone always gets this format the wrong way around
This is an ancient format
Older than dirt 
This is only getting upvoted because of stefan. Old format, limited use.
Wow! A new format I’ve never seen before!
What a new and unique meme! I’ve definitely never seen this one literally hundreds of times before!
This formats been around for years, you're cashing in on the death stefan Karl for upvotes
You're a bad person OP
Not true to the movie at all.
People get this wrong all the time. In this scene Peter sees better without his glasses. 
This format is old and already in use. 
This format is older than most civilizations
You got the 2 panels on the left wrong
you've seriously never seen this format before? 
r/forevernumberone
You made it backwards.
This sub is the worst. 
REVERSE THE FUCKING TOBEYS YOU FUCKING RAIMINORMIE
People seem to forget this is a sub for *New meme formats* it's not just a fucking meme sub. Post this on r/wholesomememes or some shit. This isn't versatile, and it's probably older than most people's dogs.
wrong template so no upvote 
This format is so old your version is pixelized.
This has been a format
Who upvoted this? It's backwards and also ancient. My coworker lost millions on this investment thanks to you, OP. 
 Versitile  
Formats so bad they belong on/r/4panelcringe
Isn't this from the scene where he realizes he sees better *without* his glasses?

So the meme is backwards. 
Is there a way to anti-invest? Like still making karma off this meme by predicting its about to fail miserably because of how old and stale it is?
Wait, where’s smitty webermanjensen? He was number 1!
Forever young
Smh, can't even use it right..
I kind of hate the fact that in the movie he actually saw better without.
Ancient meme.

It’s only sustainable now because of SK.

Don’t invest.
It's the other way around and this is a old format. 
I hate how this meme is always backwards. 

That’s Spider-Man, y’all. He sees better without his glasses. 
This has been around for what feels like years at least.

If you're going to capitalize on a man's death (which is wrong on its own) at least use a format that isnt older than my hospitalized great grandmother
This format is older than the earth 
Why is it backwards though
Except it archaic 
This format has been beaten to death. Sell sell sell
Really shitty post. This is not a new format. Upvoted for Stephen anyway.
The format has been used, just not the meme. Therefore not a new format.
Rest in piece Stefan. You were and will always be number one. 
Number One is loved by everybody. His memes will always be profitable and always make everybody happy. I will be a lifelong investor. 
!invest 100

 amp;#x200B;
You’ve done it backwards ya wank pheasant 
That’s not how the meme works
this is a dead meme. it’s old. it’s stale. why would we invest in something that already had its fame and died? we want new stuff. 
Why does he need glasses, there’s no difference
Ooft
Old retard
Can someone get the meme right for once ever 
17 thousand upvotes for a format that is old as dirt? What is wrong with this sub?
How much?
That really only works with that person
Im confused? Is this loss?
All in for Steph, he deserves it
Deleting this post in 4 hours! Make your final investments and downvote this comment while you can
I'm expecting great returns on this one.
This is loss ;-;
Very versatile. 
I get the sentiment, but mentioning Jake Paul is like mentioning the Kardashians. It's kind of insulting just to be compared to them, even favorably. 
hot take: stop using stefan karl’s passing as an opportunity to get karma
Who's the guy in the upper picture? I see him alot but I have no idea who he is
Skyrim memes are always a stable investment and surprisingly versatile. Invest aggressively for #1.
It most certainly has
I put most of my money in this I HAVE FAITH!!!
Still waiting for the next elder scrolls
Dont invest on stefens death, you bastard
Well, do you know that more than 1 redditor thinks you're hot?
OoOooOoOO this isn't a FUCKING MEME FORMAT COME ON THIS ISNT EVEN CLOSE! 
Uhm.. This doesn't seem like the place for this post unless you've got a meme idea for the pic.. 
Is it too early for me to propose? 
Hey he can’t take your looks. Or your newly accumulated Reddit harem.
Removed see rule 1
Sorry man, I’ll give you and upvote since bro got like 11k and your at 39 right now. 
But you got the looks?
You're right this is crappy
Stefan wouldn't want that
Classic comic with a new image, bravo.
Easy investment for big money
It’s another oh no it’s retarded meme
Stefan Karl*sson. Geez, he didn’t even know his name, what a pathetic baby
You messed up you don't mess with Stefan 
Uhh considering it’s a repost and will likely be deleted within the next couple of hours, 

no
This sub cannot be real

No it wont pay off because this meme has come and gone a few months ago
/rcomedycemetry
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS! 
THAT IS NOT A FUCKING VERSATILE FORMAT IT IS A SINGLE MEME! THIS SUB IS FOR FORMATS! CAN YOU CUMSTAINS AT LEAST LOOK AT THE SUBREDDIT BEFORE YOU SUBMIT! FOR FUCKS SAKE I AM SICK OF THIS!

Well fuck me, I’m gonna lose half my investment
Whoooeee! Im gonna be rich!
A risky bid, but I'm going for it.
Changed my vote to a downvote, will hold it for the first 15 mins. Remember to upvote after! 
This is one of those posts id like to see metrics on.. OP might get the highest per investment amount than anyone else ive seen. Big numbers getting played here gentleman

This is promising.

/r/unexpectedkoolaidman
OP misspelt 'plague' for extra toxicity
This is for meme templates, not individual memes, this is not a template, not versatile, it’s dead, and therefore should not be invested in. You even put your own watermark so we can’t use it as a template with some added text in a square fit up top. Go post this elsewhere you capitalist pig. This shouldn’t be in r/memeeconomy.
Imo memes do better when not linked
All in, i expect over 100% profit
40 comments in 5 minutes, looks like a safe investment
Invested half of my meme coins
This gained a lot less upvotes than I thought.

This is worse.

Just stabilise the shaft. Jesus.

I like the extra bubble. It works
Huge potential but already becoming mainstream. Should have bought sooner
This is great. 10/10 would invest even though its not doing great

Invested but doesnt look like its taking off. was clever though
Mark nsfw ffs

Too angering to the SJW community.
Sorry, no one will invest
I shall invest greatly in purging thots. 
Looks promising! The buttons could even be labeled for a more versatile format.
i don't think it'll go well in the market but it is actually fairly versatile
This example probably won't go big because of reddit's vape/edginess stigma, but it is a great template
/u/CCCmonster why did you make 23 separate investments on the same meme? Are you trying to manipulate the market?
Dumping the rest of my stash into this. To the front page!
Well, the market used to be better. But let's give this a try

Asshat.
I won’t even be mad if I don’t make a profit on this
This isn’t what Stefan taught! Short short!!
I like the format, but what the hell is the artwork from?
This is not what he would have wanted.
Everyone on this sub seems to be suicidal anyway

Help me out here. Why is his death in particular getting so much attention on Reddit? 
R. I. P. Stefan, seemed like a swell guy. Wish I had the chance to meet him.
#1 in my heart
Stop whoring a dead man for karma
We need Stefan to save this economy! go Number 1!
His face was terrifying to me. RIP tho
I know this man died but I have no idea who this stupid looking character is.
Who tf is this
Who is this?
Will someone please tell me who this is? Yes I am serious. I'm sorry no one introduced this to me as a kid. 
I have no idea who this guy is/was, and i obviously don’t get the inside jokes you see in the memes, but somehow i still like him.
Ok, who the fuck is this guy?  I've never been so lost with a new meme.  I thought I'd figure by now, but nope.  Funny face tho.
hnstly i don't get this stefan karl thing
This is quality meme right here.
I'm proud to say forever 21 was founded in my Home town Highland Park!
He was number 1 Mr. Krabs
Smittywerberjagermanjensen was the real #1
Yep, just keep whoring out his death for karma. You guys make me sick.
Can this garbage please stop? He's dead forever. I've never despised a dead celebrity this bad before. Thanks Reddit.

I'm pumped this show is starting to catch on, parts of it were slow but it really scratches that itch of Fututama Simpson's type humor 
Damn, a little late to the party here. I just started watching this yesterday, but there's definitely a lot of meme potential! Simpsons and Futurama memes usually do well, so I expect/hope the same will be true of his new show
I'm honestly sad about how little Luci says as the series goes on. He's an amazing character.

What show is this? Everyone is talking about it but no one has actually said the name.
As mixed as the reviews are, I really am liking the show, and I’m excited for a second season.
For some reason the meme just hit a second wind, 2 hours ago it stopped being upvoted at about 250 now it's at 420 (nice)
Hey Bron, you’re powers didn’t work this time huh.

Ah yes... I remember the time Ash nearly tried to fuck a pokemon.
I love this movie

Wow a label meme, very innovative 
Bear market! Sell sell sell!

I could floss my teeth with his wrists. Fucking scrawny
The meme seems rather circumstantial and limited in a nature 
Also works with “Hit the road jack”. Where CB is Jack and Rihanna is the road
The lady behind his shoulder tho 
Damn Drowning Pool/Chris Brown+Rihanna memes?  Talk about deep cuts 
Maybe add something over the lady giving the look in the back?
Saw it on Instagram like yesterday. I wouldn’t invest.

It's just your run of the mill Twitter meme. Nothing new here. I'd say don't invest
Theres only a 1Q cap on balance, which doesn't include outstanding investments. moloe0 (who is a bot) has 1Q balance + 1.7Q in outstanding investments.

https://memes.market/user.html?account=moloe0
The 2,7Q represent his networth. Because it is a bot that doesn't stop investing its net worth becomes bigger. The balance cap of 1Q still applies, but what's ranking you on the leaderboard seems to be your networth, hence rank 1 for the always-investing bot. Actual people stopped investing because there is nothing more to gain.
Possible the bot is gonna break the economy AGAIN?

I would find it hilarious if he invested 1 q on this post.

If I am going to lose it all,  let it be on a 
Stefán Karl Stefánsson/Jean Luc Picard meme.
You just triggered Eminem.
This isn't a format, it's old as fuck, and it wasn't even funny the first time
Dope...or Pedo? 
And what if I told you that I was just watching his bottle puzzle right now and paused it to see what was new on MC?...

Stefan was not just a celebrity, he was an inspiration. But most of all he was #1
Invested because it’s so true
*Choke me harder daddy*
Ironically, this is pretty much what he is doing.
Don't invest! Mods will lock this for being a repost. Happened to me twice in the past
Risky investment time.
HE WAS NUMBER ONE THO
only time will tell if the meme market stabilizes or if it goes back to the wild west it has become
How?
I've actually been thinking about this a lot lately. It's undoubtedly super annoying that u/moloe0 tops out the leaderboards as a bot. However, one could argue that for the average investor nowhere near the 1Q range, they aren't really hurting our investments much (aside from the influx of bot investments early on, which might change real people's perception of how the post is doing).

Now, what really concerns me is 'downvote bots'. I have no idea if it's a thing or how I would prove it, but I suspect that investment bots probably downvote the posts that they don't invest in to try to get their investments to rising/front page. This is really bothersome, as it completely ruins the market and might quash some otherwise successful investments.

So, all in all, I 100% agree. Fuck the bots. I guess we'll just have to see if the mod overlords are willing/able to do something about it. 
Whats the issue? I like being able to manipulate them...
Fuck you bots
Label memes reeeeeee
I've seen this exact meme like a year ago
Example? Like usually memes aren’t that complex, just pictures with labels or text at the top. I guess the most complicated ones I’ve seen are label memes with loss in them back when that was a thing...

Im truly sorry that this guy past but Damn his character was creepy 
Enough of this shit already holy fuck
Why does this not have more investments?
Investing low due to possible little future OC. Would love for an analyst to prove otherwise.

Solid meme though, like the fresh take on the SoT format.

Format is old sadly

Someone just posted a meme with this format, its on the front page.
This is just a lengthier version of the Scroll of Truth 
reposted so many times
This is dumb. Dumb enough that it might work. 
Nah, Stefan memes are stale as fuck
Give me 50k, Sammy....
Link is broken 
NO DO NOT INVEST. THIS COMIC IS INCREDIBLY TRANSPARENT AND IS CLEARLY JUST A REMAKE OF THE SCROLL OF TRUTHS MEMES WITH NO ADDED CREATIVITY
repost of a deleted post, and the same template as a meme on the front page
Format it to read top to bottom
What? Why is it right to left?
Deeply confused, as a meme connoisseur myself I would not invest.
Stefan memes aren't meant for upvotes, they're meant to honor him. Stop karma whoring off of him.
This meme is creamy
The public might eat this up. Hedging
crosspost
Let us thank our Lord and Savior Stefan for this great new opportunity.
Hahaha
thank you for making this format shorter
I mean maybe. Maybe if it's like  when your friend tells a shitty joke . But idk probably not.
Is investing in my own post unethical?
I’ll invest 10% of my profits into this meme

Original template with no text is on my profile if you’re interested in it
To be completely honest I really don’t get it 
Don't Invest bois
So you're saying... 

More stuff = more stuff

Less stuff = less stuff

??
This is stupid. What’s the joke 
What if a cringe Christian mom sees them?
Seems to cover a niche. But do you have the source pic? Hard to get more iterations without one.
Quality meme but nobody invested  :(
Y'know, I'm liking this, I prefer it to a lot of the other owlturd memes around

Feels like there's potential here.
This template has been around for quite some time, just FYI.
And a another  new  format. We need a bot like in r/dankmemes to remove shitty old templates.
I'm glad you specified it was a ton of bricks, and not a ton of feathers. One is much heavier than the other.
We have to make sure we don't milk Stefan's death but it is also important to make memes out of him. After all, he is number one
Okay, his death shouldn't be used for Karma Whoring on this subreddit. The whole point is to get as many upvotes as possible in MemeEconomy.

Stop milking the man's death. -_-
old template please don’t invest 
This is heavy doc
Which is heavier, a ton of bricks or a ton of feathers?
Can we have this without text? Great template.
Stan Lee's will be to the right.
Hmmm... this seems like a stable meme that has great growth potential.
I don't downvote often...

Dreymi þig vel, Stefán.
Living should not be torturous. Enjoy every moment of it, as that is what Stefán would’ve wanted.
Rip indeed my man  lt;3
Can we stop with this Karlson shit?? 
Press 1 for respect
This meme was already invented and invested in
He is more like a singularity
2 and 3 are the wrong way round
Should be massive, not heavy. Heavy is relative.
Easy, a pound of bricks
NOT object
This is bs. Somebody has gotta say something about the constant karma whoring here. People are just posting meme formats which are old and already established but using Stefan in the memes to gain karma. This meme format is already established and is not an  investment opportunity . Stop using Stefan to farm karma. Stop your bs. Respect the man.
Now i'm sad. Again
Don't forget to upvote to get maximum profit
These memes will never get old, just like stefan

Meh, it has no action. Very flat meme.

Stefan would want you to live a long and happy life
You shouldn't use a Stefan Karl template for a suicidal meme...
Post this again at a better time. tons of potential!
I don't need to change anything here, exactly describes my situation
This is not in the spirirt of Stefán...
But he says to LIVE this is suicidal wth
It could go both ways
Well you tell cancer that he is going to die
TONIGHT ima do it: One gun, one bullet, 2 shots, in the head (how are you gonna shoot him twice with one bullet?) ima shoot him once, take the bullet out, put it back in the gun, shoot him again.  Then ima a go to jail. One cell, one bed, all day, every day, one pillow, no pillow case.

I see you're a man of culture.
Hmm I'm gonna need some material evidence
Assassination classroom... 
The gun in the past frame could also be  ridiculous proportions nowhere near the character's actual proportions

You say like its a bad thing
THE DICK MAKES IT BETTER 
Swap dicks with UGLY BASTARD and its way more accurate
Way too complicated
Pretty sad that these low effort shitty “memes” are the trend these days. It’s literally just labelling some screenshots from an anime in MS paint with bland text.
It’s so true tho. And then the teacher says “I’m doing it so you tell the disruptive kid not to disrupt again.” But what it really does is just get the class ticked off with the teacher.

All post titles should reference buying or selling at a minimum, and you can browse the Investopedia Financial Dictionary if you need some inspiration.

Just no. 
Now thats a pretty stale.
It's really old as a meme, just search  bullshit detected  on google images
Ummm 
I found them... maybe we reinvest with different format? Google is convincing however, maybe faulty investment. I was thinking *in one ear out the other*
this template is from like last year isn’t it? Whats with all the people on here posting stale templates that were already popular like “could this be the next big thing?” as if they had never seen it before?
Sorry for assuming reddit's gender. Just going to get in front of that one.

LOVE
Seems like a bit of a risky investment, but honestly I really like the idea! Just find 2 similar sounding names to the person/thing you're making fun of and post normal quotes from them. Gotta hold onto my coins here, but you most certainly have my upvote on this one. 
It's not a format. Can't be reproduced and mean anything. Stop it. Get some help.
Its viable, but never post a meme with the same format as one currently on the front page of the subreddit.
I don't see much versatility in this meme.
Oh please dont make this a meme this has been done so many times before just littlebit differently
Very tempted to go all in
I think there is versatility. Just replace Google with something humorous. You could also replace mates with something.
Alright, I'm in.
Don't forget to downvote first, and upvote after you get your investment confirmation!

Low effort. Very high potential. I would invest.

Don't invest in memes w/ impact font no matter what the situation 
If you aren't sure you want to invest, here's something to reassure you https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/99zygy/my_collection_of_pictures_of_vsauce_eating_corn/?utm_source=reddit-android
Also it is the hottest post on r/Vsauce

Also since there was some confusion I am the one who uploaded those, this is my original creation
Hey Vsauce! Michael here!
Remember to down vote before investment and upvote afterwards to maximize profits
lost a lot today hoping this one gives me a solid return 
20% of net worth invested. Don’t let me down.
Take me to the top!
Got in on this one a little late, but still threw a heavy investment in. Let's keep it going so I don't lose all my coins, yeah? 
Upvote now if you haven't already!
Rule nr 1, wait for the re-upload 
No way this is going anywhere unless it's posted on T_D
You bring out the best in other people.
Downvote! Invest! Upvote! Profit!
Well shit
Wow. New to me, and clever. Maybe not obvious enough
Damn how do I play the new snash bros, seems like a really underground indie title 
Anyone else trying to read the original caption? Lol
So juicy, yah?
Havent seen a pooh meme top in awhile. I like it

Seems to not have much traction, but I like it.

I like the OC but I don't see much here 
Last time I heard “very versatile” I lost over 5k meme coins. 
Honestly I don’t even care if this goes well, all in because this was my morning. 
Already on the front page bois!
Well done 
Ok. This is going places.
Literally a label meme from r/funny. Worst kind of meme
Hello. Fuck you.
Seen this like a million times
Interesting, somewhat relevant. I'll make a small investment.

Illegal title, hmm?
When the other kicks start making fun of you
There was really no need to make a post about this.. the original is a day old, lost all its traction, and now this is just a repost.
Everything else sucks today. I’ll throw some money at the office 
A sudden the office meme seems like a much needed relief from all the trash posted... I'm in.

As a proud supporter of the LGBT+ community, Stefan would not have approved.
Rule 1 violation. Put something in the title having to do with economy somehow
I love these wholesome Stefan Karl memes
Got my vote
I think this one is a winner
I like it. Seems promising

Stealing this straight from bikinibottomtwitter wouldn't invest for 1000s of real dollars
Lmao no

Market is a little slow today
I’m so disappointed this didn’t take off, perhaps repost after part two of season 5 is released
omg
Great meme. I just saw this so il upvote
I see great potential here, I want to invest ! There’s a great chance for a huge turnover.
Wow this is very investable everyone should upvote and invest your memecoins
not quite sure about this one, cuz since the trailer came out, this particular part has been memed under the 4-panel pic format
A little over cooked for my taste.
Twitter text pics are not memes 
This is meh. 
Support new formats!
This sub has really gone fucking downhill, what an old format
My god... these memes are soooo bad. People need to stop with the madness.
This is just another variation of the same slaps roof of car meme.
What the fuck.
This is clever. It will be unsuccessful. 
This is precious stuff.  I wish the market would see it. 
As a label meme it’s funny and all, but the standalone image had me howling. Do you have the source image by chance?
I actually laughed. 5 Mil down!
Original pic anyone?
Yeah lemme just go eat a fucking chair
His backpack strap triggers my ocd
This is versatile but only for like a day. The meme economy is living off of stefan karlos memes and meta Stephan Kardashian memes... volatility reigns supreme. 
Hey Austria voted over 90% in favour of the Anschluss... /s

Jesus christ what is this shit?
 Bonus hole 
This is not even close to new
Justin Bieber memes? What is this, 2011?
Bad format but nice idea 
Who else read that title in yodas voice
What's this? An actual template and not just a post telling me to buy on r/MemeEconomy?
Nope, has never worked, and wont 
this just seems like a four panel version of the couple in bed meme
Vegan Gains is now going to make a death threat to Logan Gayul as well.
Yo wtf give credit if u stole it this is mine
Reminds me of the moment in Predator when Arnold meets his contact and they grab arms like this.

Sorry Stefan but I think the fallout version is funnier 
Too lazy to line the panels up?

Meanwhile I’m here with my laptop killing it with 12 different tabs open at all times.
What the hell? This format was already trending for some time. No investment from me
r/labelmemeeconomy

Ok, I love label memes. They’re great and everything. But you can’t say ‘invest now!’ like it’s some new format we haven’t seen before
This is just a new label meme of an already existing meme format.

I will be shortselling this stock.
Oh looky another label meme
What browser do you recomend using?
Literally the same  small guy vs. big guy  that we have used for ages. I'll pass
Saving in my portfolio 
Feckin' repost

**EDIT:** Guys come on, 6.1k upvotes? I've seen hundreds of memes using this template before.
What episode was this?
This is fetish art lmao
Jesus you people will invest in anytime with caps in the title. This is the same tired old format we've seen 1000* before.
Garbage text meme again, wonder why these never become popular outside this shit sub. Mhhhmmmmmm
Isnt this basically the Jason Momoa/Henry Cavill format? 
This is a label meme, not a new format.
I feel like this subreddit kills memes before they even have a chance to get off the ground
What episode is this?
This has been popular for awhile now...
whenever chrome crashes, its literally easier for me to reboot my computer than to open task manager and manually close all 25 instances of it.  Thankfully chrome doesn't crash too often.
S00Per orignaAlio LabAl meme guys invest!! 1
8gb of ram is more than plenty to run Chrome... Does OP even PC?
I like the one with the knighr against the skeleton monster format more
Simple solution, just download more RAM.
Just got a new laptop, and the speed improvement from an 8GB RAM with no SSD to having 16GB and an SSD is huge.
I'll invest conservatively. Especially the versatility and added extra layer of Jerry always outsmarting Tom possibly playing into it, assuming the audience is wise enough to interpret it.

I think /r/MemeEconomy is losing touch with their userbase.
I’d like to thank you OP. I’ve invested and now making gains.  lt;3
Get this to the top!  


And don't do the friggin thing where you hold downvote for 30 minutes it confuses investors. 
Lmfaooo 
Shifted some of my savings around so I can invest in this. Get in before it’s too late!

Make a Dark Souls format with the same concept at this one 
Seems like you’ve got a lot of extentions installed. How much bitcoin is mining in your background? Lol
Looks like good investment.
Anybody knows what episode is this from?
When was the last time you saw just one Chrome tab? He's a scout. The rest of them will be here any minute.
That’s where you’re wrong
Rule 1 vio. Change title 
I invested all I've got in this meme... Please make it works
That’s not what thicc is,calm your panties 
This meme has already been overused
Seriously, don't invest in this. Everything about it is either overused and/or a bad idea.
They are completely normal already, whether you like it or not. More than 50% of the male population in the  US, UK and Germany are overweight. 
No. The ones who normalise fatness are those who think fat and thicc is the same thing. They're not the same thing. Not at all.

RIP it turned out to be a dud
This is an old format, you can't even properly crop it and rick and morty memes have becomed so normified that it's been a bear market for quite some time. Highly doubtful something as normie as this could ever recover. Hard pass from me dawg.
Get outta here with that shit. Jerry’s a leach and we all know it.

Im surprised that someone who wrote  versatile  in their title is actually correct. Definitely usable! Invest!

Although not versetile enough to invest, a GREAT oc meme. Kudos

Cartoon memes are doing great now, investing!
My first invesment. Whish me luck.

Relatable meme, solid template. I’m in 
Holding my downvote for 20 mins, I trust you cartoon meme
I like this format but I’m also wary of the saturation of label memes on the market. Invest with caution.
I might be wrong but maybe some more value and relatability if you switched the Reddit with the sleep label
Please upvote the memes you faggots 
I love it, but I don’t think it’s going to rise enough to be worth an investment 
Don't

Still this soviet stuff always does the trick!
But are we gonna?

Jesus Christ that meme is older than this subreddit 
Scroll of truth but before scroll of truth was a thing. Bale, it's stale.

Are his arms photoshopped fingers?
What if I don't invest and downvote anyway?
I laughed. Good job. I'm in. 
This meme is so old behind the meme already did a video on it.
What kind of opportunity does this have?
I think it could be the first episode of kono suba.  I dont have it but you could get it from the first ep.
This is the way to recover the market

Can u let me know where you learned to do this type of analysis?
OP, you deserve a medal for this.

*side note:* it might also be interesting if the profit depends on how many investments were already active when investing. This would lead to more people investing in new memes, but i'm not quite sure if this would actually work out.

Great meme, love the subtle 'fortnite porn' folder name aswell. Too bad there is little investors in this otherwise I would've dropped a few mils!

I can sense potential in this format, as long as it's not ALWAYS  if X happens memes  VS  if Y happens memes . It would be WAAAY too redundant. I will be honest, though; in the immediate, i could only think of one potential meme i could make that does not fall into that category. ssSOohaaa cheers, lads (also, very classy touch, with the fortnite pom folder, in the top left corner, you FRIGGIN' natural comedian

How do I invest into this post? I think this is going to get big but I also want to profit. :thinking:
I am planning on posting an OC Template as soon as my Reddit account completes 7 days.    
    
The template is inspired by one of my favorite youtubers, who isn't even a meme.    
    
That's how meme templates are born. You see an image or video and consider whether it can be templated and memed. If all of us just started scouring our favorite youtube content, I bet we could find a wealth of templates - all depends on your creativity.    
    

 Once posted a meme here without saying “buy buy buy” and had it removed for not saying “buy buy buy”
It’s just become people taking advantage of upvote opportunities. 

A lot of reposts just to get karma. 
Why do I only get one upvote to use on this post
If we report filled in templates to the admin, would they do anything to get rid of them tho? Cuz I only want to see meme templates not memes on this sub. I would hope they would at least temporarily ban them 
But this is memeEconomy  not templateEconomy 
Oh, you mean,  Drake likes disrespecting the dead ? But also,  Drake doesn't like this fresh format used to get free karma .

I'll give it maximum 2 weeks before you start seeing this on facebook, but only if it goes well in the first few days. I say invest now, but get ready to sell everything in a few weeks.
Too much text
All of them
But it's also a rule 1 violation
I can use that same image while reading your title

Kinda concerned about OP here... 
I'll invest in star wars memes any day
This meme is old hat. The star wars memes subreddits have been using it for ages. Do not invest.
Maybe with the panel on top of the cage not cut to easily add a bit more text and depth to the meme
I really like it, so i'm going to repurpose it
We're all dying slowly
Damn you as cold as his body is at time of this comment
How do I negative invest? This is terrible, and he's already dead, not dying
How do I short a meme? 
I’m pretty edgy but I think this has gone a bit too far
So memes from dead people are a new thing eh?
Has potential, the whole sub has been saturated with that last dude that died all week, so why not this guy? What about a lazy drake remix with McCain, investors love those.
Ok, this is epic
Guys I have a lot of my balance on this, remember you're not hurting OP by downvoting, you're hurting everyone who saw a potential meme and invested.

What a fucking reach lol. So damn dumb.
This would have done better on /imgoingtohellforthis with  DIES  instead.

 Claims to be pro-life; dies  is kind of funny for any politician, but these are sensitive times.
Man..... Too soon

Dude... just invest your time in another meme. 
BOO!
Dude
Have some respect you piece of shit. 
*snorts*
Loss? No. Label? Shut up and take my investments. 
The reason I don't invest is because I can't find any uses. Can you give an example?
Please don’t bring it back
Loss is a dead meme, investing in this meme is very risky
Loss is dead. Don't invest.
How is this even a format

Oh I didn't realize this was r/dankmemes. Grow up guys and stop trying to be edgy.
Expect the same because this is America a country that was built by civilian's with guns. There isn't enough out about the incident to say if the gun was bought legally or not. What I can tell you is the place where this went down GlHF is a bar that's inside of Chicago's pizza at the landing I know because I've been there many times. In FL it's illegal to carry a gun in a bar even if you have a concealed carry I know this because I do.  There isn't really anything more gun laws could have done to stop this unless maybe we start doing mental health background checks and that would be violating your right to medical privacy.
Before you go saying some shit like  violent video games make you violent  dude was clearly deranged and madden is like the least violent video game ever. Just sucks it had to happen. I'm glad that more weren't injured 
 Lo haría pero ya me puse la pijama  has been a popular meme in Latin America for quite some time.
If it's a Muslim or and immigrant you can bet Congress will act swiftly to punish innocent people completely unrelated to the perpetrator. If it's a white guy with a gun, it's thoughts and prayers.
This is so true that I can't even... damn it. I'm just gonna invest and go cry myself to sleep.

Heyyyyyyy please give format 
Downvote, invest, upvote, then comment!
Wow, fourth one on the front page today; a meme that people are upvoting simply because they find it funny, even though it has no versatility for other uses whatsoever. Do the mods in this sub even exist? Why are you letting this sub go to shit?
Nsfw much 
you have it switched around
A wittle too late to the party. F, my d00d.
I can relate; and for that, i'll invest.
nice template with great market potential. i say  we should invest heavily
Press X memes are almost always a BUY.
Oh man, Yes! 
Also, the caption could be changed to ANYTHING that involves  possession . Nice.
This appears to be gaining more than one upvote per minute, that is a strong buy signal in my book.
Just don’t forget to upvote 
Yes best meme
One of the greatest but scared to invest 
Ok few invest alright 
This will look great in my portfolio
Such a refreshing template in today's economy.  This has real potential to be great.  
New to MemeEconomy, Just invested 100. Can anyone tell me quickly how the whole thing works? 
This was popular a while back. Not sure if people remember the format that much, so testing the waters is not a bad idea.
I read the Wikipedia entry for the movie. Had me chuckling at  communist hit man. 
Capitalist'nt
YEEt for communism!
This is anti-communist and therefore does not sell.
This is a fresh meme.  It will be big.  Invest heavy. 
Weird, but I can see how this is a thing. 
shadman in a nutshell, lol
This sub is really going down hill. Come on, this isn't even a format. 

And it's pretty obvious that this was stolen from some normie Instagram page. 
Pink on the right is hitting a fat dab
This is the third front-paged post in this sub I've seen today that has no versatility but is just being upvoted because this sub is becoming /r/funny like all subs that get big without mods moderating the posts. It fucking sucks.
Is the meme the image or the caption
Yes! Back again with the massive posts! 
Gold, as always!
Where’s the versatility? This subs for new formats, not posting memes.

Mmhmmm
This was literally seen on a meme format posted 32 minutes ago 
Iffy title, invest with caution
This is such a /r/im14andthisisfunny meme 
Didn’t make sense not to live for fun
wish i could invest:(
How can I delete this?
Maybe if you replace it with name of the guy being chris and rihanna being  madden players ? 
“Sing the fucking song Karen”


“Fuck you Susan”
the quality is so low i have trouble believing this will make it to the top.
You guys are downvoting before investing, right? Don't forget to uptove.
Place the words above the image, or place an image above the Johnny Bravo image

Meh. I think you overcomplicated it.

I knew a guy named Nick once. Fuck that guy, god had the right idea.
Don't invest.  Title breaks rule 1
Hahahahaha
I like this a lot
Seems pretty versatile. Spinoffs of this meme get fairly popular, so you can try it out. I’m not exactly a meme expert though, so let’s wait for other opinions
But like in what other way can this be used?
Another oversaturated meme that can't be turned into a format? Thanks guys.
This is as old as the concept of hell itself. Hard pass.

You cant just post a funny meme, and say invest in the title. This isnt a meme appreciation subreddit, this is a meme discovery subreddit.
What the frick is this it’s not even a template. OP this kind of stuff belongs in r/dankmemes or some another sub like it
Come on fam, this exact meme was used like 2 years ago :/
Really? An office meme from a year ago? Fuck you
What's the episode where he dresses up as a samurai? I'm rewatching the series but haven't come across that one yet.
Considering the state of r/memeeconomy, your post is easy profits for you, I guess.
How this shit have more than 3k upvotes is beyond me
Pretty sure this meme is historic
Have I *really* watched enough hentai to see where this is going? 
Not a format, it's a very limited meme and not even funny 0/10 
This is literally a fucking repost. Can the mods delete this?
The fact that this made the front page is embarrassing. 
This is not a format. It's just a meme. If you change the text or the photos it doesn't make sense anymore. This sub has gone to shit.
This is worthless
Guys, what the hell is this sub turning into!?

Not only is this actually a stale investment, one that peaked months ago, but it has no format potential.

Mods, get your shit together! 
Shit format. OP is trying to take our money and run 
You serious? I saw this exact meme at least 2 years ago. This sub has actually gone to such shit.
How is this a reusable format? This subreddit is stupid, barely anyone understands the point anymore
Yeah alright this is it I’m done with thus sub now, bye guys 
This sub has by far the best and most cutting edge memes. Easy profits, no no. Insane profits! I can see this being the next Loss. I can see this on every T-shirt, baseball cap for autistim awareness, and sweater in America. This is by far the best meme ever created and it was right here on r/memeeconomy . I sir, will be returning for more memes. I thank you for your tireless service to the internet community and I sincerely hope you are rewarded heavily for your contribution.




/s
Explain to me how this can be anything but what it currently is
Not only is this  meme  trash, OP has been responding to anybody calling him out with the same Rick gif and  lick my balls bitch.  This post is bait, OP is trying to force a different meme in the comments. 
How am I meant to implement this into other memes?
Already seen this exact meme, not innovative. 
Lemme just get my fact book real quick

**REPOSTING SHITTY MEMES IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS SUB**

I can’t properly state how many times I’ve almost typed ‘!incest’ on this subreddit 
Which episode is that second pic from?
What show is this from?
What’s that show?
Caption not needed.

hentai with senpai
Yasuke
Black Japanese guy meme. Excellent.
They make even sensored hentai watchble 
Never nuke a country twice.

They've always had it.
Woah, I’ve watched the office many time start to finish and I can’t think of that episode where Stanley is dressed like that... is it like a Halloween episode?
in my room alone vs when my mom opens the door
https://youtu.be/nXVA1G2PjpE
More office fans if this gets traction
Pretty sure some of that radiation got in their brain from the nukes 
Is it an argument to nuke the US?
Two bombs really fucked em up
Funny, but I question it's versatility
Thankyou this made me laugh more than it should have
Not very versatile, to specific
Is it me or does Stanley look like a slug at all times
Can someone explain this sub to me? Aren't people supposed to be posting formats? 
Damn this is old
THIS. IS. NOT. A. FORMAT. 
funyy deank

Invested and upvoted because this shit matters. Not in the grand scheme of things or even a regular scheme. It has as much bearing as a diorama as far as schemes go but it’s still part of my fucking grade and your gonna try a little harder on the mitochondria than that Kyle. 
The problem isn't the mods.  The problem is that of the 30 comments so far, 27 of them are investment posts.  It's all just about the game now.  
Invested because thank you 
If you read the sidebar properly this subreddit isn’t just for templates, it’s a place to freely invest on memes just based on their own merit as well. I don’t think every post should have to be about templates.
It's exam sallybus in 4K.
Versatile, but invest carefully. I have seen it on the interwebs before.
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
You did it the wrong way 
it's incorrect....

It's an older meme but it checks out
This sub blows now wtf
Literally a meme from world war 2
This meme is older than humanity itself... How tf are people investing??
Thank you! People recycling memes or meme formats isn't this sub. Why would I invest in the same old shit? 
Heck the system!!! Heck what you feel!!!
Hmm...5 black ones and a white one...seems familiar.

I'll talk to the other mods about this idea. For future reference, modmail is the best way to bring proposals like this to our attention.
What? These were already a thing. 
If you downloaded it on Android then it's save on your library
Btw if you're on Android you can download the original app and install it from the Internet  
Edit: since I got a comment saying they were gonna do this I thought I might provide some info and a reputable link to find the apk file  
https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2642971  
 instructions: download attached file, chrome should prompt you if you want to keep the file, hit yes. While thats downloading head over to your settings  gt; security and enable apps from unknown sources. once you've done that click on the file downloaded notification and hit install. Thats it, your done, you may want to diable apps from unknown sources  after that.
I have an S5 active with flappy birds on it. Def kept it just for the game. 
still have the app, can’t play though, it’s too outdated
is this 2013?
I will forever pass it on to my children
He's not wrong
r/smoobypost ? this has been around for a while
You can download the apk if you're on android, literally takes one google search, and if you have a jail broken iPhone you can download it from Cydia, I'm also pretty sure if you have a non jail broken iPhone you can still get it from things like tutu app.
Template required 
I feel like this information came to us a bit too late lol

You can also make your own on a game maker in 5 minutes. You can make it better in 10. Its an amazingly simple game.
Surreal memes are not on the rise my dude
Surreal memes must not have templates. That effectively normifies them and removes the surreal trait of it.

Can someone explain this meme to me?
Isn’t this a bit of karma whoring ? Or at the very least it’s not at all in the spirit of this subreddit ! I think we should change this sub into something kind of like photoshop battles where OP gives a blank template and some of our best memers set examples on what the template would work like. Or if OP wants to give an example, he puts in the comment instead of posting it.
Upvote because cat.

Is this versatility though? It's literally the same joke, just with some of the shock appeal toned down. 

That said, no one's ever lost money betting on US trashing.

Some female cats spray and act gregarious, but I've never seen a male cat go into heat.
Behaviorally can you really notice a difference between a male and a female cat? They’re smug assholes either way right?
Old format, but a quality one. Invested
Wait do I have to treat female cats different from males?
I’m a liberal, but shit like this pisses me off. 
This isn't a new format or new meme they're both extremely old, not even the tweet in the format is original it's from 2015 and has been a stale meme for  quite some time. 

If you type in the @ you can find this  exact same meme a bunch of times on sites like  me.me

Dead format I believe
Posting old but not wildly popularized formats is like defibrillating a dead meme so you can scoop up the karma it coughs up before it dies again.

Stale format. No potential.
Interasante
Damn I like this.
Should we invest or no?
You have my investment purely because you made your shitty labels actually readable. 
Take out the bottom two frames. 
So, ur meat beats you?
Yes. This is nice. 
Versatile, and the bird's expression is real value. But the nature aspect might make it less accessible, and the white text does not show up well. Worth a small investment, as I can see this doing well in niche markets.
no invest without template

You're really something special.
Omg he said all three trigger words. 
Shut up and take my money and also I'll take three of them thanks

Possible format but these no life invest so much into it
Not too popular I see
Cross post never do well.  I think they scare investors away. 
Care to spare a few pixels, kind sir?
You guys realize that white text with a black outline is readable on every color
The answer is c. Its always c.
Stale, no investment from me

Repost that's on the front page right now, in case y'all missed it
Economics aside, this is a hilarious meme. Great work. 
Pretty much every label meme is a retred of the same joke but this is slightly different, offering a template for new stories to be told

Huge potential! But will it hold up??
The quality in memes as a whole have taken a huge downfall. This isn't dank memes or comedy cemetery, but it seems like they've infiltrated. Not to mention the normies... eh, synonyms at this point.
There has also been a problem with too many label memes, however it will not be easily replaced by lazy town, as they are far more versatile
The Skyrim leveling system has already been popularized and normified. This is not worth investing in as it is likely to only maintain popularity, not increase in any fashion.

All in!!! This better not screw me over like my ex wife did...
How risky is this investment? I am afeared of furry infestation in reddit.
Do not Invest, this is a repost 
nice repost man
Literally 3 in a row of the same meme
Bro, Right before you, someone posted the exact same.
wtf this is at least the 4th time this has been posted today.. do people just grab a popular post and try it again a few hours later?

Old format. Careful on this one
Very versatile, in 300 trillion

Don't fall for it this is a repost! 
No potential

Reverse it and you’ve got yourself a deal

Big potential.
Oh I like this

Literally a repost from 2 days ago
Subtle change makes for a risky bet but willing to fall for traps is what makes we all invest so yeah, buying this one. 
Oh god what have I started
This is great but theres on 2k subscribers online... I might have to wait.
Wtf Vimeo no
Need some r/surrealmemes appraisal first

I strangely understood that somehow. Huh.
Needs higher recognition. Then maybe the face swap at the end could be usable as a callback to the  it's too late, mother  meme. 
No this is getting ridiculous

REEEEEEEEE POST
Do you have a template
Don't just repost stuff from r/dankmemes here or at least provide the template
Honestly though the only reason I use it is because of the family plan so I don’t pay for it and because I have to pay to fucking play an album in chronighial order
Real talk is there anyone who prefers Apple music over spotify
What is this...r/dankmemes?
Copied right from the front page...
Is it bad if I use amazon music?
GodDAMN THIS SUB SUCKS.
Definitely what we need, more label memes.
Honestly I prefer Apple Music because they have a wider selection of the music I like (more classical performances, more compilation albums, more b-sides, etc.) I can see why people like Spotify, what with all the personalized playlists and such, but I myself am satisfied with just the albums if it means I get more variety of music haha
You just reposted this from r/dankmemes after 3 hours 
Have we given up on fighting label memes on this sub? returns will be shortlived, but damnit im going to invest.
That'd be funny if Apple Music doesn't have a big chunk of the music streaming market share. Swap it for Amazon Music.
I'm going heavy in on this. So much variability, funny image to begin with, it has a cat AND a cute kid. Gonna be big.
I use Tidal, the sound quality is subtle but it's definitely there. I'm a student so I get lossless for $10. Also Tidal has a huge emphasis on hip hop, often promoting underground rap which I approve of. Their play lists aren't as robust as Spotify but Tidal also isn't putting Drake in every play list either. 
investigation 
All in (measly 5400 but it’s all I got)
Shame it's a Repost 
Reeeeeeepost from r/dankmemes. 3h difference
Eh, I can actually upload mixtapes that normally aren’t on streaming services on Apple Music instead of having to make a playlist or whatever. Plus I get to edit tags for my OCD needs. Besides that, I do love Spotify’s sync feature, but I’m just a triggered fanboy commenting on a meme though so what do I know. 
This sub is shit, the whole point was supposed to be memes templates, not memes themselves, it's just a shitty version of r/dankmemes now
This is critical role, so sell this to DnD players

Not even a half hour after the original? Jeez.. 
Well shit. Hate sorting on new and not seeing the original. Wasted my coins on this shit
Fuk u op
fuck this shit. 100M down the drain!! That was a significant chunk of my memecoin wealth!!
Fuck this post, you and your repost
I actually really like this idea. Pretty darn versatile--you could even change the right image if you wanted (incinerator, Mt Doom, etc). Don't know if this execution will take off, but I see promise in the format! 
guys, I'm seeing people invest all of their meme coins, some guy put like 400 billion into this one. please don't waste all of them because this post is getting downvoted a lot and apparently it's an old template so i'm worried you guys will be investing in nothing.
Definitely invest bois

This is the original art with the original captions. This is as lazy as it gets. You didn't even try. 
It’s gonna be a no from me dawg 
Unoriginal caption fill, generic emote face, it's a no from me.
We can't downvote Stephan memes, it's the law. But man you're kinda asking for it.

Someone explain ?
Do we get a refund if it was deleted?
Versatile, and popular source.

I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT.
I love this meme but don’t think it will blow up, simply due to its posting time :-(

My advice would be to delete this post and try again in around 6-7 hours 


Yellow was a bad choice
Hmm looks exactly the same as a post from.... 15 mins ago. U know 3 posts down?
And this is my meme. Thx.
You'll probably have better success at r/memes or r/funny.

There really aren't enough mods for the amount of post traffic this sub has, and for how often rules are broken.
Theres so many people reposting what has blown up like 2hrs ago. Very common to scroll new and see the first 4/10 posts being the exact same
This is exploding is AD the new meme mine?
Not really a template
I love AD and I love this scene, but I don't see it being versatile. Can you give me an example of how to modify it? 
Why do people always reverse the two? That’s not how it’s supposed to go.
Guys stop posting things that just hit the front page, its really shameful.
Seriously.  Be original or at least check and see if it's a repost.

The people on /r/adviceanimals legit still use some of these. Are they not aware or do they just not care?
Nostalgia for memes that died in 2012
A little of both. If you're investing to make coin, there is still opportunity to make coin.  If you're investing to show support of excellent products well, yeah it's dead.  The game component of this sub has overtaken the community's goal to be the creators of new content.  I've had some mildly successful OC, but I am losing interest in spending time making new material or formats because that doesn't perform as well as the  game  portion of the sub on average.  We'll see.  I'm thinking a short break and perhaps the market will be reset.
Its a combination of both.  There is still plenty of coin to be made.  You just have to be selective about it. Get in early and diversify your portfolio.  
Its a bit of both, I feel there's fewer quality posts, but they're still there if you're attentive. Also there are some decent ones you can make money on if you get in early.
 It would be nothing short of irresponsible to question something with so much overwhelming evidence behind it , yes it would be pretty irresponsible and stupid don't you think Flat Earther?

They're not the same meme tho. The top one is describing 2 things that are the same that people don't conventionally see as the same while the bottom one is something that people see as a poor rip-off of the other.
Why is this like the 5th time Ive seen this on here
Should've left the dog alone.
Pretty niche, but i'm all in regardless.

I hope this makes it to the front page. Let the message be spread and I guess go ahead and invest. Its getting upvotes. 
Upvoted to help investors
Create 50 more account just to upvote this
I’ve watched this sub evolve so much, but I think it’s reached the point where there are enough users, enough posts, and a great currency system— only formats should be allowed. Examples should go in the comments. This would stop reposting just for karma. All these “new” “buybuybuy!” Formats have no intention of actually lasting and are just a quick karma grab. There’s no REAL discussion anymore. It’s like we’re trading penny stocks. And maybe that’s the bots fault for operating on such a small window of time instead of a more realistic one like a month, or even a week. Everything is gonna be a repost, because by the time anyone even notices or cares, the investments are all done.

I really want to like this. But the lack of color is an immediate turn-off because it won't grab attention, and the bottom-to-top flow delays comprehension. No go from me.

How is this a meme? Or a format? Or anything?

This is a meme not a format so you not now what this sub is for?
I still beat tho
Yea but it is just a kids show. Coming from a kid raised Christian 
How is this versatile?
Okay here’s the deal. Yes, it is correct this way. But for the comedy of the meme and for it to be funnier, it needs to be the other, wrong way. It sucks, but looking at it, the joke is delivered better that way. 
This format is old as fuck
This looks like a fucking tumblr meme normie.

When you realize All Star was written for a movie called *The Mystery Men* and just happened to be in Shrek.
Not a filthy repost?? What is this? 
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME 
I see this going places!
THEY PERFORMED IT LIVE AT THE END OF RAT RACE


Same format.
Man, you must really not remember the late 90's at all if you think smash mouth was defined by Shrek.

So this is what it’s like to get more than 17 upvotes 
Invested heavily in this
Or you could just go to /r/labelmemes where this belongs
The first time I heard the song was in  Rat Race  I could be wrong but I'm sure it was out before shrek 
I come here for investable memes not rehashes of the same label meme with different skins 
This doesn’t even make sense. So a serious music career is about to be killed by smash mouth but then smash mouth is killed by shrek?

You can’t just slap labels on random things and have it make sense. But who cares anyways normies will upvote these shitty “versatile” templates
Digimon used All-Star before Shrek.
the best r/jurassicmemes format of the era
Eh. Images are too blurry to make this coherent. No investment from me.

It’s a label meme but at least it’s fresh. Buy while it’s hot cause returns are gonna fall off quick!
Where da template at!?
Jurassic Park memes? I can get behind this.
I'm starting to hear memes where there is no audio.

Anyone else hear a bass boosted *HEY NOW* on the last panel? 
Where’s the blank?
When I was 18 and a few months out from graduating high school I got an internship at a video editing place where they did NASCAR and Football highlights. This one dude with spiky hair walked in to this room and starts shooting the shit with the guy I'm interning with. He says,  man, I don't know what I'm going to do tonight. I could either go home and grill up some steaks or my buddy is going to chill with the dudes from Smash Mouth later.  He then looked over at me as if this one piece of information was going to validate his existence. 

After look at me in silence waiting for a reaction I said,  Smash Mouth sucks 

He left the room a little dejected and the guy I was interning for said if I agreed to talk like that to him all the time he'd hire me.
I still listen to Astro lounge to this day. I had that CD when I was a kid and loved it, later it was in Shrek and then they turned into a meme. 
Fine meme, but if it wasn't shrek, it would've been something else. 
These labels make no sense. Smashmouth and A serious music career should be switched. And even at that, weak meme. It will do well because y'all have no sophistication.
They didn’t need one after the success of that song 
 Fuck you Shrek, you turned us into a joke. We were finna be the next Beatles!

The top panel can probably be removed and the first label can this be moved to the left side of the second panel to get the same effect.

The article does not exist. This was already exposed as a fake multiple times. First they tried to start a memewar with Stefans name in their banners and now they also want to manipulate the meme economy. He would be disappointed

This has potential, but the markets are volatile! BUY, BUY, BUY!
Idk, you may be selling this format short, there may be some versatility if you change top and bottom text. I can't think of anything right now, but I feel like there's something to this format.

To be fair, Buzzfeed *is* shit.

Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold, guys!
I'm trying to get some big gains from this!
Hey I've been saying buzzfeed is shit since I found out about it..
Did buzzfeed make a *really* shit article or something recently? I’ve been seeing a lot about them lately
Remember that one day when this got reposted like 20 times
You *see* music, huh. I usually jut hear it.

I like this meme format. I can easily see how to change it, but I have no idea what to change it *to*.

Label memes don’t work so well when there’s a pre-existing label above yours. It’s not visually appealing. I’d recommend immediate sell, cut your losses 
How is this versatile? I like the standalone joke, but I'm failing to see how the setup could apply to anything else.
Who's paying tho?

In what way is this a meme?

Not versatile, not worthy of an investment
This is a bad headline. It may get deleted.

I want to watch the Office again
The recent buzzfeed hate is from Russian trolls bc it put their leader in a bad light. They’re trying to blend in w us by jumping on the bandwagon of buzzfeed hate. 


If we really want to expose the trolls, we don’t jump back on the train when it’s convenient. If we *truly* hated buzzfeed like we say, then everyone should already know. An ill advised joining in with Russians is not just harmless like you may think. Their disinformation and divisiveness start at levels like this where they can stir up hate without getting any real push back into who they are. 
Remember everyone, the whole anti BuzzFeed meme is being pushed by the Russians because BuzzFeed published an anti-russian story a few days ago. Don't be a sucker.
Reddit’s really juicing this lemon
Obvious Russian psyop is obvious.

I see a potential success but not someting that will last too long. I say go in strong and take out profits fast. Invest wisely.

Fuck buzzfeed, but does anyone know what’s with the massive quantity of sudden hate-posts towards it?
This meme is (imo) an attempt to make buzzfeed seem like an illegitimate source of info. Probably by alt right as a way to make the trump dossier seem less credible.
Im investing my entire life savings.
All in. Yeet!
Russian disinformation campaign against buzzfeed
The Stefan article was fake and BuzzFeedNews.com actually provides decent honest journalism. The other site is just an entertainment site like so many others out there. So why are we mounting a massive smear campaign against an entire publication now? This is just so stupid. 
So we attacking buzzfeed again but this time it's over a fake article to farm karma?

This ones going

LMAO
They r starting to get very reposty. Invest now, sell soon.
The recent influx of spoungebob memes has made me think that all memes will eventually turn into spungebob. I believe that you could take a frame from any spoungebob episode and make it a meme.
Not bad, but doesn’t have a lot of potential. I’ll invest my meme coins elsewhere.

THIS IS THE ONE BOIISS
So versatile because we all wanna jump off the cliff sometimes 
this could be it

that was it, we did it bois
To the top we go!
Invested! Also because I love this game 
NOT THE BIONICLES!!!
I’ll upvote anything just cause
Great potential! Very easy to normify however, so caution is needed.
Low effort too.

I MADE THIS FORMAT. STOP INVESTING.
Credit to u/grafxart 
For letting me repost his higher resolution version.
Brilliant! Can’t wait to stick it in the deep friar! 
Whats fixed?
Also requires rotating images, so it won't be normified as easily
A little late to invest, but I like this one a lot. I see potential with the format as well.

19 comments in 4 minutes! This is gonna be a big one!
Repost from a week ago, investors beware!
The market already offers a lot of memes like this.
I believe that it would devalued due to inflation and a drastic shift from quality to quantity 
Badly memed. Not worth investing
WHAT ?
This has been done a billion times. The market is saturated :/
All-in for this one. ^w^a^i^t ^no
can we please stop reposting this
I invest -100
Discuss the meme here
I’ve seen this done but she’s holding loss lmao 
If you do it right, I’d assume so
No, this image will be shared but not remixed causing it to die out fast.
No racism
No fap.
On the rise, Ladies and Gentleman!
I see lots of potential here. HODL
..what sort of potential? How would the setup look? I'm not seeing it.. 
I think the template has already been posted though..?
But can we go even deeper?
It's hilarious, and you gotta invest in what you love. I hope investor sentiment turns around and shows this product the appreciation it deserves.
Can someone write the explanation for this in words?

Second one is with blank cards for extra versatility.

This formats bad and you should feel bad
Anyone know what this is from?
No weeb
Little update to everyone that downvoted this format: you got reason, it's horrible. So how the heck someone reposted and got 300 upvotes?
Come on man, this is funny but doesn't even remotely fit this sub. No versatility potential and it's not even a meme really. Just a funny story/joke. 
I don't see this maturing. Sorry but I can't invest
Market performance is average at best right now but it's a bear market this morning and this is already on the frontpage of the sub. I'll make a small bet on this one.
Versatile for many reasons:
- he can pull different “hateable” things from the box, leaving room for many different versions.
- the text on the box can be changed, making this an entirely different context
- In the last panel, his father can be shown beating him with different implements, even the one he pulls out of the box for a darker comedic effect
This entire series is full of untapped investment.
Investments are slow, but I like. Gears are turning here. I think you're onto something. 
No contract no deal. 
I feel a wave of highly profitable meta memes coming on
I'm going all in!!!
This is a great format! Invest early because this is growing fast!
Dumping all i got into this
I've got a good feeling about this one, boys!
Fuck it boys. I’m all in!
All in, lads!
Is there a template available?
Fuck this is one of the very few memes that have gotten me to laugh. I see big potential in this one.
Can someone please tell me the original context for this?
Hahahaha I'll Invest and price it at 9.75/10. This is genius! 
I was expecting  You Broke Reddit  
I like this, just need a little more convincing before I invest

Anti-buzzfeed memes are still hot but I think the market bubble is almost ready to pop, and this format crashed a long time ago already. I'll upvote but won't be investing.
Invest, I predict this will be the last valuable buzzfeed meme for some time 
Not running hot for this one. There are actual racial differences in skull shapes. Too many risks to ignore.
OMFG NO! THIS MEME IS LITERALLY 2 YEARS OLD IT IS STALE! STOP REHASHING THE PAST!
You're getting zero upvotes because this format is on the front page. 
This meme is too artistic for an investment. I hope it stays pure to the message, I won't be up voting for artistic purposes.
Ironically not a new meme format

I love the new reddit.  Don't @ me.
Y'all ever heard of the reddit is fun app? It is a lot better than the reddit app in my opinion. IDK if it's for Apple but I know it is on Android.
New reddit doesn't like my adblock. Old reddit is where I stay.
Your home?
I really like it, definetely lots of possibilities. However it could be normified very fast and lose its value
I like the redesign because the images are already opened. Any way to get this on the old reddit?
I couldn’t stand the old design..
I posted one for you!
Wow never seen this before! 
Its always the fucking Baby Bottle Pop song for me. Low key kind of a bop.

this is going down in history!
All in on this one, tons of potential.

If the second panel is 2d why does he have a shadow? 
I feel like this is just another scroll of truth meme
So just paste a random /r/Showerthoughts title on the last panel?
Why does the 2nd panel have a shadow on part of its face?
I don’t know what to think anymore 
I saw this while I was high, and I could understand how to not understand it

Scroll of truth strikes again
Wow I feel like an elevated being after coming across this post
Yeah I’m just on my phone and was hoping OP had a blank template :3
So basically shower thoughts in panel form.
Isnt this just a new  scroll of truth  or  hard to swallow pill  or are we aiming this to be more self reflective
Not if you’re insane... 
I see a reflection licking my tongue
1st and 2nd dimensions are lies
Duuuuuuuuuuuuude
Add a 4th Dimension with two tiny pictures of Kanye and Kid Cudi please
Poor bastard cant see his own dick?
Do you have a reflection in 2D???
One day my dad will bring home that milk he's getting
If you lick the side of your hand and push them both together against a mirror you can lick the tongue's and the hand's reflection 
There’s depth in your second dimension panel
i'm 12 and this is deep
On a typical graph, the horizontal axis is X, and the vertical is Y.  Therefore, since X comes before Y, witdh should be the first dimension, height should be the second.
That's some deep shit.
Nose, cheek if you smile hard enough,

Plot twist, no gold. For anyone.
I don't think anyone here will get gold to be honest
Choo choo motherfucker
Was this posted just so commenters can try to bait gold?
You tried
Is this a template or was there an original comic?
What exactly is gold, anyways? Besides being something that you can rub in other people's faces
Subliminal messaging
Dont encourage people to buy into Reddit gold.
Hahaha look at that stupid gold chain. They don't know this chain is better 8)
Too long to be stolen, that’s the only way memes can evolve now
It's an old template though.

The memecoin thing just gives people incentives to upvote any garbage repost they see. It’s ruined this sub 
Why are meta memes allowed here
This is such an old format ffs
BAN THE MEME INVESTOR BOT

It's killing this sub.  This godawful shit deserves no upvotes, but because of the investors everything is inflated
A ~~risky~~ safe investment, but fuck it! In for 10k!
This shit is more than a year old. This sub is almost more normie than r/dankmemes and r/memes
This is already an established format. Also, a repost. Original here

Damn Daniel is, was and will always be a normie meme.
Never invest in it
damn daniel shouldn’t in the front row it was a normie meme and it was made way latter then all of the other memes
Where's the versitility? I will not be investing.
The age of image macros was a simpler time.
Damn I don't see this taking off and it's definitely a bad investment but I'm still going to put in 100 as a way of paying respect to the old ways. 
It's an old meme, but it checks out.
Where's the confused crowd guy
This isn't versatile in any way, it's just a onetime shitpost
Pay respects to our meme ancestors, all the way back to Vid comps and rick rolls. THOTS AND PLAYERS
Bad Luck Brian was the format that I discovered memes thru, It will always hold a special place in my heart.
Your mistake, my young memer, is assuming that these memes are dead
*kicks in door*


 if you watch anime your opinion doesnt matter. 
Tip to get rid of those, get a disposable shaver and shave them off. Usually works
Posted like 12 fucking times overnight, Jesus. Woke up and started scrolling and this thing is everywhere.

I bounced on my bois dick to this template for hours. The only thing faker than NASA and the moon landing is my relationship with my girlfriend. I only keep that shit up to make people believe I'm not actually completely asexual and impotent, which I am due to the  Alex Jones male vitality supplements  that I spent $1,100 on, just to be handed estrogen pills mixed with ground up Gila monster. Anyway, I just hope that the cloud people can't trace my IP address, because that is how you get airplane holograms flown directly into your house and even though Trump is president Obama is still controlling the drones.
ALL IN BABBBYYYYYY
Initially I thought it's another 'johny-johny-yes-papa' meme 
Schools hammering useless info to kids 
It only gets better with context 
upvote after investing!!
Imagine believing that NASA lies to us. 
Jeez kid, you got a lot to learn about the market. 
Fuck these reposts
Great value here! BUY BUY BUY!
Fuck it in for 2B
Excellent addition for my portfolio!
this meme will have like 83 upvotes after 4 hours
Nothing wrong with investing in communist propaganda, comrade

Why even post this on meme economy. Yeah it got a chuckle out of me but first off it's a label meme. And second, it has barely any versatility. Just post on r/dankmemes, fry it a bit for r/deepfriedmemes, then reap your karma and carry on.
Oy vey goyim, another label meme, no shekels for you
Buy as much as you can!
I feel like that is from fishers 
I’m not sure how this could be used. Any examples?

Now you know the troll in all of us wants to leave it down just to do it..
We need a culture of upvotes! Downvotes are for when you post offensive or unrelated content. An upvote is for when a post fits into the subreddit and you like it, even on r/MemeEconomy where score is kept. You don't have to use the template yourself, and you don't have to upvote if you don't like it, but you should even if you don't love it. If you don't like it, there's no need to downvote if it's related to the subreddit, just don't upvote! I hardly ever downvote anybody and I encourage you to do the same.
That could also work with KSI and KSI's meat.
I see great potential! In for 50mil!

This is very unoriginal and can ne replaced with anything hitting something
The guys anger in the top left corner. Priceless. 
This is trash
This is one of the worst memes I’ve seen in a long time outside of subs like /r/ComedyCemetery.
Her DM’s should be the target
This doesn’t make any sense. Why would “Her DMs” be shooting “Hey”, and why would it be traveling the opposite direction of the rest of the labels.

Too many labels. I’d hold off until I see better application.
It’s kind of busy, the current market demands simplicity 
I cant see the label
photonicinduction
what the fuck does that even say
I assume it has high  market liquidity, BUY BUY BUY
Invested, looks promising 
I must say it doesn’t seem very flexible, perhaps some more examples could persuade me
did you just assume the meat's gender
So meta!
Wouldnt investing be backing your statement? Cause....
People are actually investing and upvoting bad luck Brian, I am officially unsubbing from this shit show
The face on the guy labeled me is the reason i invested again. Quality meme
All in boys! Let’s ride this baby to the front page!
This is just another jab at the  distracted boyfriend  meme.

Someone looking at an object/event to the negative appeal of that person's friend/significant other.

I see little to no potential in this.
Remind me of the last time a label meme lasted for more than a few hours before fading into oblivion? All you fucking normies keep reusing the same format with different pictures. This is literal garbage. Don't waste your investments on this. 
This is just another mediocre label meme, don't invest
The only person in the foreground isn't labeled. Kind of a glaring omission TBH.
**OR JUST TAKE IT TO FUCKING /r/LABELMEMES WHERE IT BELONGS HOLY SHIT**
This is just the dude checking out the other girl’s ass meme

Is that the Space Needle? LOL @  lack of Seattle dress code. Wear T shirts to places that others propose at. 
Ah sick, more label memes
Another 3 panel meme. This one will crash within a day. Sell sell sell.
When I was 7. All I wanted was a  kick ass GT Dyno BMX bike. I remember I kept bugging my dad 24/7. Finally after following him around the house for 3 hours yelling  Hey Dad! Hey Dad!  He finally snapped and said  Fine! I'll call bike shop!.  He picked the house phone up and said  Yeah bike shop. This is Scott's dad. Do you have that bike he wants? Sould out? Ok, thanks.  Hangs up phone  Sorry kid, they're sold out   

That floored me. I stopped bothering him. It wasn't until several years later I realized he never dailed a  number and how the fuck would the bike shop know who Scott was or his favorite bike was? God I was stupid as a kid
Change kids to wife and friends to sisters and man oh man would that be me 
Absolute garbage 
Hey friends!  This stock photo looks like it was taken at the Space Needle in Seattle WA!  It was recently redone to have a see-through floor as well.  It's a really great place with high quality meals at very reasonable prices. If you visit Seattle, this is the oine and ONLY thing you should do, dinner at the space needle.   
The birth!
Can I get the original format
Dude the fact that the guy in the back that brought her there for a regular meal rather than a special proposal one is reason enough he’s a keeper 
So literally the same fucking meme as the dude turning around to look at the girl? Yeah pass
I respect his game, it’s either the appetizer on the table, or it’s the dessert. Either way, he proposed before they took a bite! imagine taking their first bites engaged and sending it back? Mind blowing 
If I ever have kids, those shit machines will only get the finest products, bootlegged from Korea, or at least Germany.
That man's mustache is the first and only one I've seen which is genuinely sexy.

Well ~ just wait until you see how Asia parents deal with their children in this such situations :v Instead of worrying about it , they just ignore you no matter what their children says / begging / crying / bla bla bla ...
And “all of their friends” usually turns out to be like one, if you 3rd degree’em

I feel bad for the guy who posted this the first time. I know the feeling of having your altered template get more likes than than the op. It sucks especially if you found and created the op
I see a lot of comments that it is another version of “distracted boyfriend” 

I feel like In a week buzzfeed will be having an article saying some dumb shit like: 

“ first we had distracted boyfriend, now prepare for... DISTRACTED GIRLFRIEND” along with a top 10 memes created on reddit. 

I dunno ; I’m going for the short term investment

yep this is quality meme economy content
funny but no versatility as far as I can see, could you present another example for the investors?
That's Edd tho.. 
Wtf was the point of posting this?

You will probably get less than you think
Does it look like 2005 to you?

Damn, this is a legit meme economy post. I had to explain how it is excellent to my wife because she has not seen Top Gun, wtf? Lol
Get out of here with that bullshit karmawhoring flair
What's the original context? It'd be better to post that, so we can more easily use it as a format.
Not sure you know your American political spectrum... right side moves away from govt, left moves towards. Naziism/socialism is far left, anarchist and libertarian are far right.

I see a hate BuzzFeed meme here. A wise, versatile investment.

To be honest, my initial reaction was  Wow this feels weird to see so soon/in bad taste  because of the groping the other speaker did.
Is this a motherfucking JoJo's reference
All in on this one !

No. It's not that funny.
i would invest, except there is a typo. Not a high quality meme anymore. Ruins it. do not buy

Can someone explain the versatility of this to me?
I thought this was on r/funny this is way to limited in its potential. RIP all ye who invest!
How are we even supposed to use this format?

I won’t be investing and don’t recommend that anyone else does.
The funny thing is it’s true 
That grammar tho
Great post but only 2k subscribers online... 
My first investment it's a risky one but we'll see
after the great rick and morty meme crash of 2016 I advise everyone to invest cautiously

Xbox is the one that brags about its graphics, ps4 brags more about their exclusives
Only with fortnite, so why bother 
This format has a lot of potential, super versatile
Jerry = PC
You could substitute play and song, but aside from that, don't know if it will be able to be duplicated successfully.
Bad meme. Just put in a *haha funny meme song* and get tons of upvotes, low effort.
Somebody just posted this not 3 minutes ago
Market instability already confirmed. PewDiePie reviewed this meme and it involves Fortnite, an already normified game. Although, Metal Gear Solid could be an effective template. I would hold onto it until another text meme comes around.
It's not really that versatile at all.
It’s like one of them Japanese animes

Yall know me so well
Me every day for weeks now
Yep. That’s my day. Couldn’t sleep, work sucked, got out late, went to comfort eat some cheesy bread and dropped it upside down in the oven.

Still laying here on the floor redditing after I literally threw cheese everywhere and had a crying breakdown for a few minutes. I’m working on getting back up. Maybe. Floor’s pretty comfy tbh.
 lol look at me my life sucks isn't this so funny ecks dee 
/r/me_irl
ooooh will actually invest in this.
Happened to me at work on Friday last week. Had a shit week all week and knowing I had to lose all of Saturday and Sunday to work as well wasn't making me feel any better. I was agitated all night and copping abuse from both customers and chefs (I'm a waiter and it was fucking BUSY, not my fault there was an hour wait for the food and not enough seats for everyone who walked in, saw a 50-person line at the register and decided to stay anyway) and just as I was almost calmed down after the customers and the last of my helping staff had left about about 10:45 I walked to the back of the restaurant and noticed the disgraceful MESS a birthday party of about 30 people left behind. That got me to boiling point seeing that shit so close to finishing time, but what tipped me over the edge was when I tried cleaning it up, the remainder of the now semi-melted ice cream cake they had in the box on the table fell through said box and splattered on the floor. I just lost it and started kicking over tables (and that fucking cake box which was now on the floor) and tossing chairs. Hurricane chromattix just blew in and he was NOT happy, at least that's how the area looked afterwards.

Lucky no-one was around to see what I did so it never came up. 20 minutes later I cleaned up the mess but only because I felt sorry for the one staff left finishing at midnight who would have had to deal with it, not because I gave a shit about what I did (otherwise I would have left it and clocked out for the evening, I've seriously lost all respect for the place because it drags me through the same bullshit every weekend) and seriously FUCK whoever's birthday that was. Hope it's their last if they and their families are going to be fucking PIGS like that!

The real question is: how did he loose teeth?
the only investments were new accounts
It is known
Watched it a few weeks ago, it was indeed informative.
It would also make a nice meme.
All in in this one. 
This sub has completely gone to shit since the invest bot.

  


Everyone single post spams the word invest. Almost every single post is a meme and not a format, or a long dead format with no new twist or reason for resurgence. Every single comment section is almost entirely about how much you people have invested in the bot comment chain.

  


There is no overall meta discussion on the direction of memes anymore, except to day that label memes are too prevalent.

  


I'm out of here. I fucking hate whoever built the bot and ruined this place

228 comments, only 7 of which aren't under the bot- and one is  !invest , 4 of which are directly about the bot/ points.
This ones going places. Hopefully up.
I would not recommend investing personally, this meme format is already over a month old and the returns people got for investing in it diminished rapidly after the first day of its existence. Don't expect to profit from this. 
Literally just a repost from dankmemes. I ain't investing in a used meme.

I tried typing 7abouttorape9, but that didn't work.
Wait but this this is a super old format. It’s a fine meme if you want to post it somewhere else but usually this sub is for new, cutting edge, on the come up formats.

Becky 
This was proven that it was photoshopped 
Just a heads up, everyone, this meme is multiple months old.
This is a bad investment at best and an unethical one at worst.

Mario Odyssey is too old to be a fresh meme and too recent to be a vaguely-nostalgic meme. There are plenty of stock images that could creatively convey this stuff, or something either *more* or *less* relevant to be in the meme zone.

On top of that, the punchline is  the thing in panel 2 is bad,  which is more easily exploited with the Chum Bucket meme (which ironically is *still* a better investment despite its age). The twist is that the bad thing necessarily has to be cringey or disgusting or abhorrent in some way, which means if this meme ever *did* gain traction its only use would be political strawmanning.

In that sense, this exact image is the perfect use of this meme - namely, demonstrating why this meme isn't worth the investment. You've saved us the work of making it lamely political and vaguely outraged.
Why is this sub so bad now 
Wow /r/4PanelCringe and /r/ComedyCemetery rolled into one very old meme. Do not touch with a 10 foot pole.

This gets my first 100m in don't let me down
fathers don't end deserve fathers a day day. Wut???
Fuck you for posting my content
I will just straight up say it: for the majority of time fathers had it much much worse then women. 

I mean they still do tbh. All this crap with being a mother is hard is just justification for being lazy. Like me when I operate the digger at work claiming my bones hurt now, so I can justify not being outside in the dirt digging holes with a shovel.

While I have stress on work, get frustrated, destroy my bones and think about ending it all.... My partner can sit at home, cook a meal once in the middle of the day, clean the house a few times a week, most just do it once, and fucking watch tv with your kid or go to the playground and have fun with other mothers.

Imagine she had to work, then she would clean houses 8-10 hours every single fucking day, with a 30 min pause to quickly eat something.

At the same time I have to work the entire day, and on top of that also solve all other problems and have responsibilities as well outside work, like raising the kids. And most of the time I get the bad parent role anyways that says no, so the woman doesn't even has to deal with that stress. 

Yeah, fuck fathers, am I right?

No purchase from me-limited versatility and not all that funny/creative, IMHO.

It's pretty old tbh.
Enjoyable, but far from new.
This is not a format! This is a genre of meme! r/boottoobig

I saw this as an image post weeks ago and still have it on my phone 
You do realise this doesn’t have to be the original post right? People can copy stuff
When I watch this meme, I look back to the time my memes were called genius, and think how ridiculous that was 
Copied
I see prime real estate with this. 
I'll put a grand into this, see where it goes.  Has some versatililty if you change the bot name and description of where it is and what it does.  Fairly text heavy, but savvy users might like it.

Too similar to the change my mind one. Invest CAUTIOUSLY. 
this meme template is old

Okay what is it with some of these meme economists trying to make bank of old memes
Tru tru
This meme is long dead and not remotely funny let alone worth investing in.
Fun fact toothpaste doesn't need to produce suds but companies add the sudding ingredient to make it similar to soap so it feels more satisfying 
This sub has become nothing but r/dankmemes reposts by karma whores pretending formats aren't old af

What about jokes *about* Amy Schumer 
 All my friends 
I like this one a lot (mainly by I'm a DHMIS fan, but still)
Im in love and im floored this hasnt already been done. You sir, are a genius
She got Bailey Jay on national television. Shes a winner solely for that. 
That’s not true Amy Schumer has told some hilarious jokes it’s just they also happen to not be hers.
i’m friends with my dad
The only funny Amy Schumer joke is making fun of how unfunny Amy Schumer is.
I need this template someone pls help
honestly, without the top part's descriptor, this image is 10/10
 I saw this meme, and my vagina was like, Oh No!

What do you mean? The fact that she tries so hard and fails so miserably is hysterical

I feel like this is similar to the  and this is where i woukd keep the X.. if i had one  meme

She does have that one about her vagina 
What's funny is that jokes about Amy Schumer are as unfunny as her own jokes.
Look at all these time travellers from the distant past thinking these weren’t massive memes already.
She was so much fun before she was famous when she appeared on O amp;A............what happened Amy!?!?! I hate that Comedians refuse to trash her for the joke stealing embarrassment that she is. Even Joe Rogan, king of the Joke Stealing Hunters.  
This template has some real potential! Imagine if someone put SOMETHING behind that door and replaced the word  nothing ???
! create
her jokes?
Wow, I invested on this meme on a previous post that didn’t get as many likes

Another label meme. Nice!
I always sort by new because if I sorted by popular there wouldn’t be new stuff every time I got on 
When was the last time a  meme  on this sub actually caught on and became a meme?

For a subreddit called Meme Economy, it's incredible how there's absolutely no analysis of the meme economy. It's just people saying  invest?  in an attempt to get some quick karma. 
How do I block a subreddit 
This is not a new format.
Petition to change /r/MemeEconomy to /r/ShittyLabelMemes please
Never invest in a dead digital camera company 
Sorting by new, you will have to sift through shit. Sometimes, literal shit.

I searched by new for a solid week once  amp; felt like a hero. Until someone posted a picture of a shit they just took...

Are we not talking about the horrible clone tool usage? (or whatever it's called in Photoshop, I'm a Gimp-Pimp)
Funny how this guy gets more upvotes with this obvious repost than the original maker, zoom right above the girl's head 
Stealing from /u/jeikjeik99 eh?
Why the fuck is it riddled with butchered use of the clone tool? Plus, holy mother of jpeg compression.
This is The Room of label memes. Jesus Christ that clone tool abuse
Yeah it’s a label meme but at least it’s taking those ‘sorts by new’ meme people down a peg

I like that you didn’t use the word “versatile” in your title
Swap the labels tho lol

You meme stealer
Congratulations. You played yourself.
I’m all about sorting by Hottest. I come to Reddit not to think too hard, and Hottest does most of the thinking for me.

This is brilliant.

Commenting on this comment section is very risky. I shall get a lot of downvotes but fuck it
I thought personal attacks aren't allowed
I've deleted a comment after getting some downvotes because it made me realize that I was being much more rude than I intended to be, and that even though I thought I was right, the way I said it was not.
Like the best part about people who delete downvoted comments is that you can only get like -15 karma from a post anyways. All of the extra downvotes don't change your karma at all. You can even get a net positive karma from a hugely negative post if more than 15 people upvote you. 
It’s actually third biggest. They forgot about OP’s mom.

Only suggestion before commencing public trading is to perhaps reverse the panels. Solid projections though (and a lit source clip).

Oh wow you can invest here too lol
Will this include heavier moderation to remove reposts and old formats?  Most of the new material is drowned out from memes that are already several months old.
Is it really that bad? 
I’m glad you guys are putting your foot down to make your lives easier.

Also I like the “My fellow Americans”-esque touch there.
Is this a real thing? Like do you purchase the initial meme coin? 
i made a new meme from a web video, i think it has potential  
it is empty canvas for anyone to use, but i dont know what would be the appropiate sub to post it to. Help?

I would be the same.
Change the flair bro. SELL SELL SELL is for memes that are dying. Yours has potential, so use BUY BUY BUY instead.
This meme creates a paradox: if a time traveler comes to the past to tell you that your son's a furry and you proceed to shoot your pecker that would negate the need for the time traveler to visit you in the first place since you wouldn't have had a son which the means you wouldn't have had to shoot yourself in the peepee. But if you don't shoot your willy you would be visited thus a loop so it creates a time paradox. 

*Unless multiverse theory*


Damn, this one's going to the top
I see great potential, I’ll invest
I mean ya, but the market has so much better shit, I would have saved it for a rainy day when the market has hit a low. Other than that a C tier meme
Can we just change this to MemeCemetery? 

This is like three years old at least. 
Invested to into this, pls word

Talk about a shot to the pills
I'm going to invest, but only a little. The potential has already maxed out with the Furry product cycle.
wait if he did that, wouldn’t that make the time traveler not have to time travel anymore, thus making him shooting himself in the genitals useless? 
But it's actually the adopted one. 
His trigger discipline scares me.
This has lots potential to make it big, everyone invest now
But my frogs are still gay
Original image (without edit)?
I've never seen this, is it OC?
You’re doing it wrong
I'm holding this meme for ransom, I didn't actually make it.
Label mem. Fuck that
What can this be used for?
The sets aren't mutually exclusive though, so the percentages don't make much sense--label memes can be single use, OC formats can be a comic meme, etc.
What's your sample like?

So much potential especially with the possibilities of changing what the fortune says. 
I feel as if this meme could use a little more editing, to keep it away for being easily used by the normie folk.  Then I think there will be potential for this format.
Please get me a profit. I've been on a losing streak lately
repost, bid with caution
This is beautiful. Versatile and easy to understand

So I’m lost as too how the commands work with the investor bot, and how you either gain or lose memecoins. Also how many do you start with or how do you get them in the first place?
You have the labels the wrong way round

General Reposti! You’re a sequel one!
First of all, old format, second of all, a sequel meme? A man of your talents?
just another label meme *sigh*
By triple rare do you mean from a while ago on this sub?
The format has become the punchline with you people. This is why you cycle through so many. You people make shitty normie tier memes. 
This is pretty old
Didn’t this happen 3 years ago?
Idk how investing works but im lovin this meme!
It's been around for a long while, nothing new
I don't want to ruin the joke but I learned this recently and it's interesting:

The reason the gun emoji got changed is neither of the three reasons in the meme. It's because the gun emoji could be used to threaten people. There was a case in Canada or so where some guy send a gun emoji to his ex-girlfriend and she then was scared about her life.

Because of that they changed it up, not to combat gun violence.
Stamp of approval. Big returns inbound!
Change it to a prequel meme format and I’d buy it.
ALL IN 347k!!!
Seen it before. 
Alright I'm all in

Does anyone on this subreddit actually use the internet at all? This is old. This was literally made into a meme already. 
 Change the question to buthole licking and invest hard
 invest before it is normified  lmao it already is since it took off many months ago
Is that supposed to be Wojtek?
Very few questions would make full sense in the context of the third person being a bear under cover. Of course, you can change it so it doesn't matter that it's a bear, but I've seen enough stupid shit around here and would rather not. 
My god is it a meme to post massive memes from the past and pretend you’ve never seen them or are all these normies crawling put from under their rocks like parasites?
The terror, anyone? 
 gt;Every single meme posted is an already existing format from months ago.

Yeah... time to unsub.
“Would you fuck a trap?”
“Would you shit in the woods?”
In case anyone is wondering, the original artist who made this is “jakelikesonions” on Instagram 
This is quite possibly the whoriest way to get upvote on r/MemeEconomy
1. Find a post that gets some attention and a lot of upvotes.
2. Wait around three months 
3. Post it as your own and let the karma come in.

 Would you go bearback?

Why’d you have to go and do Shrek like that?
Tbh having a GF always made me watch porn more. All that sexual energy is self feeding.

It also helped that she really liked porn and watching it together
What’s that on the far left? It looks like a band logo.

 Everyone likes playing with Woody, until the honeymoon period ends. Then the Buzz wears off, and you and your partner don’t always want sex at the same time. 

 You work 17 hours, and come home. Then your partner wants you to Piggy back her, and stick your mouth in her like you’re Mr. Potato Head? You try anyway, and you realize you are just a Slinky Dog. 

 Then the next day you wake up and feel like Emperor Zurg, and your privates are roaring like Rex at his finest. So you get up, and act like your the Claw ready to grab something special. Then she looks at you like a three eyed alien and makes squishy noises while denying your advances. 

 You already know your defeated just by the look. You know you fucked up because it will take an entire lightyear before you get a chance again. 

 Suddenly, she’s Barbie and you’re Ken. You have no privates and no sex life. You’re worried about clothes and your house more. Neither of you notice nipples. 

 So just like the toys you play with yourself and make up stories while no one is looking... 

 ***The end.***

 (Everyone in a monogamous relationship needs porn sometimes. Girls and guys included. I wish sex education in school taught that. Instead of telling me men want sex more; and women don’t enjoy it. How wrong was that.)

 PS: Then a year later you come home early and find a bunch of smaller army men shooting into her without parachutes.

Repost, do not invest

https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/9co6sv/invest_now_very_profitable/
But won’t we let Stefan suffer when the world ends and he’s all that’s left?
While I am unsure of the values of investing in this meme, I do see that it could possibly have some value. My current position on this meme is to invest a small amount now. 

Memes with a sexual orientation have shown to be valuable in the past, see 'oh yeah put it in' as an example of a meme with a sexual undertone. This is due to the relatability and taboo of such a meme. The meme being 'wrong' causes more interest and therefore creates a greater interest in the meme. 

In conclusion I do believe memes of a sexual nature such as this one can be a positive investment if caught early enough, they do sometimes have a short life but it is possible that one can invest early and sell early. 
Oh I’m using that
Its a template you twat
/u/W334 is the mother of this meme
I'm in for the long haul on this one. Get in while it's on the rise!

This meme already came and went last year. So many reposts in here.
Lazy. This is a repost. Not only that, it has little versatility. If possible I would invest in the failure of this meme.
Stop right there criminal scum
Risky one. But I'll give a try.

Wait what the fuck
“Wherever you want hon.”
“Oh I don’t care where we eat, you choose.”
“Alright, how about ______ ?”
“Nah, I’m not in the mood.”

Eject sequence initiated.
This is 100% fake
This happened to me in middle school and I was forever an outcast after that.  Oh how things could've been different
How versatile is it though?
Maybe I'm getting old but some of these memes are about as complicated as calculus these days. Like I *get* what you're saying because of the order I read things in, top to bottom. But idk how the beyblade gun(?) represents your interaction with the cops.

I'm not just talking about this specific one either, there could be a picture of a woman tripping over a dog laying next to a chew toy while she drops her stack of dishes and  every* part of that will be labeled as something and it's so hard to figure out.

Should I still invest?
Everything portrays mental health better than 13 Reasons Why
Season 5 trailer dropped aw yeah
I still think the show Wilfred provides the best look into what mental illness is really like. On the surface it's a silly show about a guy who hangs out with a guy in a dog suit, but it dives really deep into mental illness issues, schizophrenia, acceptance, denial, etc. 
All in for BoJack boys
What is this, a crossover episode?
Another scroll of truth meme in the makes
It's just a slightly different 'Hard to Swallow Pills' format. Would not recommend investing.
I see Bojack I invest! 
r/sadhorseshow
It's just the scroll/sword of truth/hard to swallow pills/other  unpopular opinion  formats
Invested 200 for the meme. 800 for the gospel truth about Bojack.
This is just the same meme with a different format. This is the scroll of truth, Ed’s Book of Facts. New formats not ‘new’ formats
This is just the Ed, Edd, and Eddy meme....
Fuck 13 reasons why in its entirety. Suicide is an issue, yes. But the show glorifies it despite claiming not to. I watched both seasons and they were both shit. They used horrible things people experience for shock value and views. The bathroom scene in the second season was disgusting. Not because it was graphic and horrible but because it took such a degrading act and used it to disturb people and gain views. The whole show made me want to vomit. Killing ones self will not make you live indefinitely in people’s guilt. Killing ones self will not make your life become the focal point of others lives. It will not make you important. It will hurt the people who love you and end your life. It’s not something to romantics not glorify. Fuck this show. 
fucking breathing oxygen portrays mental illness better than 13 reasons why
MYY SANDWICH! ! ! !
Well no shit, show is made for 13 yearold girls. 
Holy fuck, it does. Like, this isn't even a fucking meme
13 Reasons Why incites bullying. Imagine being in 8th grade with all these crazy ideas of what high school will be like, and then watching that show. 
Investing on my first meme  amp; thankfully, it’s a BoJack meme
Fucking hell, did you screenshot your phone while the pic was fullscreened, rather than just saving the fucking picture? This idiot sub can’t do anything right. 
I don’t think anyone on planet earth argued that 13 Reasons why portrayed mental health in any realistic way.
Bojack AND Friends in one meme?! I love it
Congratulations, you made an obvious observation that no one on Reddit will disagree with
Nyaaah
Couldn't handle the show after he tried having sex with a kid.  That was an unnecessary stretch and killed it.
This is just another scroll of truth meme in disguise 
Literally the same as the “FACTS” book meme.
When is the bojack circle jerk going to end?
Does anyone else really thinks those  I'll just write on top of an image  memes weak and lazy as hell?
Copied straight from r/bojackhorseman this post literally is right below it

Invest for quick returns only. This meme is only relatable to reddit users and thus probably won't be normified.
This is so nice. 
My balls after I pee.
Jokes on you my girlfriend doesn't wear a bra yet...



But she also doesn't exist.
The inherent difference between a stock market and this meme market is that there is no scarcity of source. A smart investor does not want to have what noone else does to drive his price like RL. Here we only make coins if there are others. I dont want anyone going broke. I need each and everyone of you to help my investments grow. 

Stop posting memes with shit titles. 

Stop letting your coins die under these posts. 
So that's how TV based memes work?
Flip the panels around cos AT ending is rougher than memes are great 
A meme mentioning sorting by new is always difficult to normify but the market is currently saturated, invest with care.
U clicked reddit not 9gag

I think the second and third panels of the note should be flipped, right? Either way, I applaud this one ~~even if I don't throw any coins down~~

Then realise that you made a spelling mistake in one of the panels.

R u ok OP?
This is a horrible meme and you should feel ashamed of yourself for making it.

...is what you probably think everyone is thinking about your meme, but in reality we all think it's funny. 
a bit too high effort to be a format, but a wonderful meme in it's own right.
I like how you deep fry it just a liiiiiiiittle more in each of the last few panels.

That's how I knew it was almost done cooking.
In the case that this is actually a cry for help. PM me we can talk. I've been through depression and anxiety, I know what it is like. There are people there for you and care about you, even us strangers on the internet.

Are you doing okay? Do you need to speak with someone?
First I was gonna upvote. And then I was gonna downvote. Then I wasn’t going to vote at all. Then the last panel made me upvote because it does take a little bit of thick skin to submit stuff and I can relate to the feeling of anxiety.

The first rule of meme economy 
Dont talk about meme economy
Alright, welcome first of all.

Here’s how I understand this subreddit.

They represent the “exchanging of securities,” in other words, they exchange money (MemeCoins) for Memes, and after a set period of time, if the meme has garnered enough upvotes, the investor can receive a positive RoI (Return on Investment)

It’s like the NYSE/NASDAQ or any other exchange, except it’s for memes.

The subreddit community info should give a better insight.
Its treason then...
Would ya just look at that!
Okay. I won't. 
yeah but if u build tools they break eventually
You could make some ironic memes with this
Even as a xenoblade fan I don’t think it’s that versatile

Pretty sure people like porn memes more for the source rather than the joke. Nevertheless, invest!

Oooof ouch my bones
Lhana rhodes ass is nice. I jerked it to this exavt video

This will not take off
I doubt this will become too big, but it’s clever! Well done :)
Timing is everything. The market will accept this gem at the right moment 
Yeah, this hurts my eyes just trying to figure out what I’m looking at. I’ll pass

Wtf. This is about five years old and is as normie as they come. I wish this sub had some moderation. 
This is old. DO NOT INVEST!

You search for  porn  when you want to fap? 
Make sure to downvote before you invest. Upvote after! 
It's not our fault that people post old formats, but it is our fault that we upvote them. Cmon people.

Just because it makes me laugh doesn't mean it's worth a click. Lot's of jokes make me laugh. Votes are only for the best ones.

Wow. I only just realized. Fortnite is the new Minecraft. When Minecraft was just becoming a thing I was the same age as all the kids who now play Fortnite...
Where's PUBG fit in here?
Kinda like Virgin vs Chad, huh?
Logic me boi
Compared to Fortnite, Minecraft is a metaintellectual contemplation upon the purpose of the universe 
I thought MC got turned into a kid's game though? As in the devs are catering to little kids? I stick with modded to avoid this, cause a lot of tech mods are strewn with big words and complex recipes, and sometimes even multiblocks, that most kids can't grasp, plus there's setting up machines and automation and whatnot. 'Course, I'm one to talk with my spaghetti wiring and outdated knowledge. Oh, and magic mods too. So, a more accurate version would have two  Boys  doors, Fortnite and *vanilla* MC, and the  Men  door would be modded.

I like the format but feminism is not a useless idea 
As a woman I agree with the sentiment. This crazy third wave feminism movement is completely ridiculous, over the top, sexist (ironically enough) and just downright nuts. I have never experienced sexism, none of my fellow woman friends have either. My male friends however, have been subjected to women demanding all sorts because they think it's the  man's prerogative to supply them with whatever they want. False rape charges, less than equal rights when it comes to their children, paternity leave issues etc. These are all issues being experienced by men all over the world and we as as females are complaining about how we're not being treated fairly? 

And no, I'm not talking about those countries where women can't even getting an education, in that case I agree with  rational feminism coming into play. What I'm talking about is the middle-class, entitled well off countries like in Western Europe and America that have very little to complain about in the grand scheme of things, acting all bent out of shape because they got cut off from grabbing the closest parking space by a car that happened to be driven by a man. It's completely ridiculous and you're giving the rest of us rational, sane women a bad name. 
Does anone have the original format?

While this meme IS straight fire, porn memes are just to big right now, so I’m afraid this will stay low until the storm blows over.

Fuck you for stealing my post you cuck 
I’m sorry sir, but I’m going to have to revoke the downvotes on this post. Unfortunately it has been stolen, and you are under arrest

A simple, direct meme like this could work very well in our current economic climate. Personally, I would try to integrate the image and the tweet more closely to increase the meme's effectiveness, but other than that it's a solid investment.

Very versatile. I like how the top half has an image with text, and the bottom half has an image with text, and they’re related. 
u/abelg12
What WikiHow article is this from
Lol  Very versatile indeed! I have a question do I get memecoins for making the posts?
Chris, why did you post this.

 amp;#x200B;
It would be more versatile if  WikiHow to teach your child to swim  was cropped out :/
But CPR doesn't work underwater 
r/Disneyvacation 
 gt;New

TIL it's 2008
Wow, I think this format has a lot of potential, never seen it before.
Investing all in on this one
I think you posted the wrong picture.
 Thing I don't like  memes are a fading trend, but the directness of this meme could give it some added ironic value. I think it would do very well on Instagram or another 'sub-dank' website.
op is right you know
This exact same thing was posted yesterday.
*hard* laughter...
This is just fucking relatable tbh
What’s nice is that these are ACTUALLY versatile. I respect it. 
Shows up **invited?**
Ok this is getting out of hand now.
This is a bull market boys. I'm buying.
think a cropped version would sell better
These really work best when the image is cropped to remove direct context
I'll invest, but only a little.
Got a source?
Could be improved by switching around which sin is replaced based off which one the thing people do best corresponds to
I'm real short on porn memes right now. The market is saturated.
I mean technically if they have an artist signed to their label that has recorded the songs then they own the rights to that version of the recording and can jib you on that. It's shitty and shifty Bru technically legal.
hm seems worth it as my first invest
Repost from this morning?
r/Raimimemes is leaking. 
Wow, couldn't wait 12 hours to repost. 
Lol the original post is listed directly above this one at the moment
Don’t forget to upvote the post after you’ve invested 
Dont see this one being a big earner. Pic is too blurry and just a smile not a fake orgasmic thing.
It's REPOST
Can relate
Edge-y post
Just need 179k to go... that’s like a single subreddit of doing their part
Iron man must be missing a comma or something.
I would invest, if it weren’t a full two weeks late. I’m not risking my family’s wellbeing on something that’s going to collapse like this meme
^(I ain't gay, but source?) 
th last seat
Why does a close up picture of Mia or raileys faces get the NSFW filter but this shit doesn't? 
what is number 1?
This is cropped porn isn't it 
Source? (for a friend) 
 Hard and fast  see what you did there 
 **Chloe Cherry** 
These porn memes don't have any fire exits! 
Please comment link as well
I always upvote these memes and then downvote afterwards when I realise it's meme economy and this isn't a new meme format.
Can someone link the sauce to all these memes
Just invested 2 mil here, better go well
Is there a sub for porn memes?
#Wheres da sauce
Just change the pics to whatever trending meme is flooding the market at the time for easy profit. 
A niche product. I expect a fall in a few cycles. Invest while you can.
Enjoy your heck hole, Ladies. 
Oh, I ain't that kinda Christian 
TO EVERYONE. Is never too late to invest, meme still relatable because porn memes are still high, front page and NSFW marker. Investments are still profitable. 
r/gonecivil
Just not in front of my salad guys!
I love all the Riley Reid ones, that chick is out of this world
Wait a minute...this lesbian bar doesn’t have a fire exit! Enjoy your death trap, ladies!
Meta, trending topic, classic Simpson's scene. 

Great investment. Little late to the party otherwise I'd be all in.
Do you have an album of the included memes?
Someone needs to make a cumpilation of these memes
Do these types of memes even have a name for themselves? 
LMAO when i show my muslim friend these memes
People usually post a sauce for every single image. You degenerates know your porn too well.

^^^^please ^^^^link ^^^^sauce
Does anyone have a source for the top left meme?
Oh I get it, none of porno memes have children in them.
Thats alotta S A U C E
Where can i find porn memes?
Is there a collection of these somewhere?
Can you post an album of the memes you used? I think they’re hilarious.
Seriously lol, the religious must think about sex alllll the time 
Is there a subreddit for these memes? That’d be cool
Yeah, not used to the over 18 porn scene eh? 
So xtians don't see porn? Or porn memes? Or what? I don't get it. 
Penny stock quality meme, don't bother buying. May see an anomalous spike in price today, but it will return to baseline by tomorrow.
Porn memes are getting out of control. To the point where I'm starting to believe all the conspiracies about how they are targeting kids and hoping to destabilize society.
I've always wondered, do christians really never get off? Like ever? It doesn't seem possible
Christians are suppose to be abstinent, porn is all you got until you are married. 
This may even save us from the porn memes.
This explains a lot
 Okay....how about....an elevator that takes you to....the bottom of the sea, or something... 
Invest 250
Market is too saturated with porn memes. Invest with care. 
why are these porn memes now becoming popular 
Where’s the sauce

Where’s the link, THE SAUCE
Oh my gosh, we got some sauce, but we need more sauce 
sounds like communist propaganda but OK
Link
I'm slighty optimistic regarding this. Fighting back and being the underdog is something everyone can relate to even though it's all fucking meaningless.
I am unsure. This is taken from attack on Titan, a show where they actually kill these creatures, making this a poor representation of what this meme is about.

That would only apply to the market share who know about the show but still
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
Funny How this is a repost
Memes sind das Essen und wir sind die Jäeger
For all I know this could be a repost
You better not fail me doug

You have to rotate the image around the text

Are you kidding me? This meme is around almost 2 weeks
You expect me to invest in Instagram-watermarked property?
Who the fuck guessed x?
/r/bonehurtingjuice
This isn’t a new format. The purpose of this sub is not to post memes using a format that already exists. That’s what r/memes is for. The purpose of this sub is to suggest possible new formats while giving an example of how it can be used. I’m so sick of this sub being used to dump people’s dumb, unoriginal memes in.
Excuse me what 
Can someone give me the png template for this?



The normification of Thanos memes is wearing off due to the movie being out for so long. I would recommend a cautious investment (but not this format which is already dying)
Big if not repost.

I am too ashamed to ask for the source
Is it appropriate that I suggest everyone go all in?

what about infinity train
Lmao but Cartoon Network has ninjago
It’s true though. 
Why does Cartoon Network have to make everything gay. Princess bubblegum proved not to be gay in previous episodes wtf 
This one features a Dr and mentions other memes. Solid investment 
Oh boy, no. Please don't. Damn it.
A lot of these dances were already huge in the black community before Fortnite came and popularized them to a larger audience. So kick me out if you want to but I will be milly rocking (swipe it, to the uncultured) my ass off every step of the way.
bigeth true
I mean, as far as dumb kid trends go, dancing is by far the safest. At least they stopped eating tide pods 
Why do people seem to hate Fortnite dances? They're just dances.
They were real dances before fortnite hijacked them so ima still shoot my way into some coochie

It blows my mind that there are 80 investments and and less than 40 upvotes. If you're going to invest why aren't you throwing it an upvote too??
Incredibly malleable 
Quite strong tbh

I actually haven’t seen this one before. I like it.
This bad boy is going FP!!
Too bad it doesn’t say “4:20” pm.

There should be an entire sub dedicated to Elon's left brow.

No. An economy must be able to move in cycles to be sustainable, not merely move to the latest fashion exhausting all avenues. 
In this world there are no bald people, only poor people
Didn't know that Elon was bald
He looks healthier at least
1.1 billion in. get in there fast. 
Elon is reverse balding 
Does this count as a JRE meme?  Because we need more of those
Downvote. Invest. Upvote. Comment.
he didn’t inhale

This sub just became dankmemes2.0. How's this a new format?

How did he get his hair back?

Yea, while his stock is declining. 
Get in ther now! BUY BUY BUY

I liked how rogan kept joking that Elon was either a robot or an alien 
Lol the sad part is he didn’t even inhale
I’m not a smoker but I don’t think that blunt is supposed to be smoking that much
I wonder if anyone who worked at Tesla has been fired for failing a drug test for THC?
This was one of the most interesting JRE episodes in a while. Elon seems like a cool dude. 
I'd switch the first and second pictures but other wise solid investment.  
Always surprised Tony Hawk helped invent PayPal. 
The top left panel and the middle left panel should be switched. 
I'm a Fassbender fanboy. I do not know this movie. What is it?
I watched it live, it was amazing. Covered some really interesting topics, had some updates here and there (mainly future announcements) and was just generally a nice conversation.
There's a whole lot of positive Elon Musk stories on Facebook and now on reddit. I wonder if he is paying for a PR drive after behaving like a dick the last couple of months.
He looks so high in the first picture. Look at how red his eyes are lmfao
LoL smoking weed and shit 
 Elon Musk smokes weed  

I don't give a fuck unless he said  this weed from Aphria is fucking dank  and it makes my share price go up. 
Buy buy!
Buy high, buy high! Wait ... 
I want to see someone make a YouTube channel on which memes to buy and sell. 
How is this a new format
Im so high rn and say elon is the greatest in the world greatest the world greatest in the world
I knew to invest the moment he hit that’s shit. 
Classic micheal scott move on that hair 
Why tf does he look like Shawn Mendes’s dad in the last picture?
The first rule of Muskenomics is that Musk meme values always go up when Tesla/SpaceX/Boring Company stock prices go up OR down.
The top post on r/MemeEconomy is an Impact font meme? Aight.
r/enoughmuskspam
This should be reversed. 
Wow I didn’t known Ariana Grande was sexist 
Hey OP, can you comment link for format?
Decent template, but people don't buy on just the template... I think this particular meme is too niche to gain traction.
BUYBUYBUY
Its death begins on this sub
Memes don't start at meme economy lmao. This map is like a  what Reddit thinks a meme cycle is  map.
What if I just upload the hottest meme on meme economy directly to comedy cemetery.
The ultimate death of a meme is when it's shown on television.
You forgot r/deepfriedmemes pulling content from everything mentioned here
Life of a Meme:
1. Someone posts a meme on a subreddit that isn't r/memeeconomy
2. The meme is reposted on r/memeeconomy and everyone is told to buy
3 The offsprings of that meme are reposted to r/memeeconomy and everyone is told to buy
4 The meme has been reposted to death on r/memeeconomy until eventually someone reposts it but tells people to sell
5 More people repost it telling others to sell even though it's already been done

Edit: In conclusion, the meme economy almost single handedly kills the meme by insisting it's a template instead of just letting oc be oc. If oc could just be oc, then there would be no need for an economy.
You forgot the part where Pewdiepie finally kills the meme with his signature attack

Old format, wrong sub
This a sub for appraising memes, not making shitposts
It's funny watching the lefty outlets faking moral outrage at Musk smoking weed. The double-think required to glorify  Healthy at Any Size  and pearl-clutch over this evokes a certain morbid fascination.
What’s the sauce on this, please and thank you

https://i.imgur.com/m3mysy1.jpg
I hope this one is here to stay
This is a great one. I rarely put real karma/money in the market but this is an opportunity I can't pass up. Honestly, I think if anything this just hit the market too late. If this came in about 7 hours earlier I think it'd have a much greater market share. Regardless, I think it's got some real potential. Even enough that I believe it has hope tomorrow-- and hopefully onwards. Which means a lot-- it's said that more than half of memes fail in their first 24 hrs. Lucky for me the machinations of musk memes make up a motley crew of multitudinous mundane magniloquent and mellifluous mores. And that's pretty predictable TBH.
damn Shawn Mendes got old

I think this meme will be dead within a week. I'm already sick of the Twitter jokes within a day. It's too forced

New meme format for the history books.
So flexible, this will be the Apple of the meme world. Valuation near a trillion easy.
Looool

I love watching YouTube only to find something that could be a meme, then rush to reddits front page and sure enough. Ya boi Elon.  Rippin one. More like puffing it but amazing none the less 
He forgot the word  over  and we have the prequel to cars, no wait Stephen King already did the prequel to cars in the 70's trippy shit.
I don't get it how can it drive the country?
It runs on water, man!
 gt;Old format. Been around for years, seen it on Facebook. Too normie don’t invest

-r/MemeEconomy
That’s one Musky meme you got there!
Meh, don't we already have a stoned guy meme?
I like. I'll take 2 please.

So then...we could just launch the car into outserspace...who WOUKDNT buy a space car?...I’d buy a space car.

When u make a android user think.
The wonderful machine that can throw a 90kg object 300m, this meme truly brings a tear to one’s eye. 
I can see halo memes blowing up
Extremely versatile! Just add the missing word and shop an image onto the button and you’ve got yourself a great meme!
Hobestly at this early I think OPs karma is the #1 factor for profits and it seems solid. Love the meme too so invest.
its over
what happened to mac mill?
As a writer and rpg player i relate so much
OOF if only I hadn't invested everything already.
This format is definitely not on the rise. This is an unwelcome and forced comeback meme.
Usually people only post new formats here.  This i unlikely to see any success.
Old format. Risky investment
#I GO CHOP YOUR DOLLAR
Dear mr sir , i would be gracious to help with said meme. In exchange i request a humble sum of $419. Kindly pm me for details. 

god blesses ,

Big oof the amount of memecoins lost on this
No only robby rotten
Fuck you I'll up vote tomorrow

Don't invest on this. It ain't going anywhere imo.
Is this an endorsement of hotmail?

In a niche market, such as /r/wholesomememes this format would work greatly. But other than that - it has no chance of survival anywhere else. But I will invest some of my fortune. 
This sucks. Don’t invest.
Not likely to go anywhere save your investments
Only in America would you have different guns for different types of occasions.

but there isnt ANY NEW VIDEO
Unfortunately it really has become like this. 
Zie ik daar een Unox-muts? De kolonisatie is begonnen
 gt;investing into a meme with no template of which to make content with

The format’s also pretty lowbar. “Here is thing, is bad” is *the* stalest of memes, and this is just stretching it out.
No sauce????
The day Vape Naysh came out the steep decline began. I havent even watched a full video of theirs for a year or two now.

H3 productions is bad now????
to the front page more than half a mil
I love Ethan and Hila but they should just close up the h3h3productions shop and go full time podcast. Leave the channel up for the archives but no more vids because it’s clear they care much more about the podcast. 
These 2 people are the worst 
“It really” man
Spam f in the chat
Boats and hoes
While I still love both Ethan and Hila, their content has gone downhill and they need to get their shit together
Template please.
now they do podcasts and shit like that for the money.
Is that jiz?
 gt;”X” is bad

Is this memes of the future? Just saying something is bad in an unclever way?
That's me everyday going to college
accurate. h3h3 sucks. ethan and whatsherface are sooooo fucking lame.
Gonna need that sawce bawce
Is there a meme advertising standards agency/FTC? Because this is far from new and is lying to potential investors 
Fuck this shit.
Under NO circumstances are you to post these until October!  YOU'LL CRASH THE MARKET
Wait until Spooktober!!! We do not want this bubble bursting before Halloween. 
WAIT UNTIL OCTOBER OR THEY'LL GET STALE!!
Repost, not funny, and nkt October. Please commit die 
if these are posted before october the market will crash and they might (god forbid) become shitty instagram memes!!
This is terrible.
Literally years old.  Do not invest.
Don’t you just hate it when this happens?
No we're not bringing those back

Early investments in a highly non versitile meme will crash this market before the doots even begin. Pull out before you lose those meme coins
Who the frick is upvoting this in September!?

Eh, this meme sucks.
Stupid as hell.

You know the worse part about them ending Adventure Time, is that in like 12 years you know they're gonna try to make a reboot.
The best season was 3, dont @ me 
This is just a meme, and the template is old wtf, what happened to r/MemeEconomy ?
Hope they will make quality season after Rama
Terrible meme.
Any porn in this store?
That show was terrible
Probably not
I wanna see season 2 start so all the big investors can get back in it. And bc i started after them and wanna see where id line up
Funny, but the market is too narrow. I need diversification in my portfolio.
Trashy idea, trashy concept, trash execution, trash meme. 
This won’t go anywhere. Sell.
I'm riding this one to the top!!!
This one sucks. 
We need EarthBound formats.
It's on the front page right now.. 
That isn't a new template, and can only be used once. What you did is steal someone's meme and post it here without even taking time to crop it.
ban anyone that agrees that this is a solid investment 
Press F if you've left yoshi behind
Upvote!
Yoshis are tools to be used and left behind
Sorry, but this is not a template

Don’t invest
Great short term investment! Could be redone with Ben swoll
Found the straight edge philosopher you guys 
Found the smartass you know Elon is smarter than you think?
I'm no expert but it seems the text to image ratio of this meme is way off. I'd be worried about losses investing into this personally. 
I'd love to see the Calvin and Hobbes trend catch on!
But do they thank each other? 
Sell. Old man memes are just too limited to old man things. Not into it. 
Ya done goofed

Made by gang weed.
I say risky. It’s a label meme, but it’s also completely original.
The people who actually made the calculations were very diverse.
Don’t get me wrong, this meme will profit, but the market will spit out some more solid investments soon so save up those memecoins boys
Remember to **dislike first**, then **invest**, and then **upvote!**
Is this real?
Both halves could be taken into memes.

But this put together as it is isn't viable.

Propose a hostile takeover and divestiture.
Highly versatlie format, never seen before. I'm all in.
 amp;#x200B;
“new”
this video has been out over two years ago, and definitely has surfaced as a meme format a while ago. invest very very cautiously...
The only problem with this is how stolen it is
Not many. Only those with an iq can understand the meme.
Because they're reposts
Haha so funny *downvotes*
This is literally a repost from a few days ago
Spooky memes suck, especially when they’re reposts.
DONT POST THEM THE MARKET WILL CRASH
Succeed

Boring is the opposite of spooky.
Can’t think of anything besides the bottom panel being “tried to warn them” or “no body listened”
Please work or im going broke!
An Australian meme? I’ll take two please 
This format is fucking ancient though, this is just a  new  pic
Isn't this just another label meme? Also, there's been multiple pictures like this already.
these kinds of memes are really overplayed, don't think this is worth it
Black ciri... Yeah I'll fap to that
50 comments in 15 minutes? Get ready to ride the wave!

I can make a greenscreen version where there is a green square instead of the upvote if anyone wants to use it
Deleted. Damn.
Remember to upvote the post for maximum profits!
How exactly would you edit something like that?
What’s the vc
Wtf that fool deleted it! The economy!
High quality yet low versatility makes this a speculative investment, going to keep this one on my watchlist for market movements and will reevaluate
People have and will just take individual frames to make their memes
Pump and dump!!
So hot!
I don't like sand..
G*sh h*cking d*rn
Do you have the unedited version (without the upvote)
r/funny will eat this up... Aka normify it
This is just repost, its not even a format or formatable
What happened to HQG???
Watched thisovie last night just a wonderful film
Deleted? Wtf m8
Template please!!!
Time to get it to r/all in order to normify it
I've seen a 3 panel version on r/raimimemes along with this.
Hard to normify also means 0 growth. This will not catch on but it is a funny one off meme
Spider-man is in right now! BUY BUY BUY
Weird. I literally just watched this movie last night.
#ENHANCE! 
Someone should make one with Reddit gold instead of the upvotes for those who want to give gold but can't 
Me grabbing for water in the morning after a long light of drinking.

This is oddly satisfying for me to watch
The fact it’s on this normified sub has already normified it
but its not funny...
Why doesn't he just control the other sand to separate from what he's trying to grab
where is this from? Looks like the beginning introduction of wakanda in Black panther
Netflix the source of all memes
Oh fuck this a good one
Too bad the vsauce template is an old existing meme and this particular template has little to no variance.

No versatility. Thanos memes are dead.
Repost of a shit meme.
Sell, absolutely dead meme.  
Potential but working needs fixed.  Will pass on this one.  
Very old meme. 
This isn’t even mathematically correct. At least the root 2 one made sense. 
Ehh, not mathematically correct. Maybe do something original with it, like the 

sq root of -3 = (imaginary item)

Don’t use the triangle.
This isn't even correct 
This feels just like the dead “book of facts” meme or the scroll of truth. Not to be critical, but it is the same idea. It does still have some potential though
It’s too legendary. It’ll be gold forever imo
I fucking hate VICE sooooo much
I’m afraid I don’t quite understand the format
Honestly might boycott Netflix if they fuck up the Witcher Series, it’s my favourite books and Game series... they better not flush it down the toilet. 
Of you use night mode, the words at the top bounce around.
Can confirm, hot format.
Belongs in r/CommunistMemeEconomy

Mods can we please ban people who repost this exact meme daily.
I always wondered why he didn’t just use the space stone to create some sort of subdimention and move half the people there. Or maybe just make half the people half a second out of sync with time like In Doctor who.
He had so many options, but did it because he was narrow minded. He thought it was the only way because he didn’t have the power before.
Why don't we take the universe, and push it somewhere else!
Isn't that because infinity stone were created within the universe so they can only alter things inside it, replace things but not create things or actually destroyed them ? Like when everyone turned to dust everything was still respecting Lavoisier's law ? My comment may sounds dumb, it's not really something I really _thought of_ 
All in, all in! I'm riding to the front page.
What’s up everybody, it’s Cr1TikaL
somebody will combine this with this week's SFW porn stills and it will be the r/MemeEconomy version of  a latex Infinity gauntlet with memecoin gems

Format? Also the format could be a meme of itself.

Risky investment, but could be big with all the traffic it will get
Wow! How original and creative OP! This format has certainly never been done before for the countless musicians who have overdosed. Someone give this guy gold he's bloody brilliant.
You get a down vote for this. This is a BEARISH investment!

Florida has had open carry blades for years, ok meme tho
Why?? Why the fuck some need a reason to do that ???
But... but California has always had this...
I just put 2/3rds of my portfolio in
Now this is a good meme format! 
I'm more scared about people having access to unscrewable pommels
If someone hones their skill of the blade and decides to instigate trouble, I will respect their authority far more than any guy who bought a gun. Swords are dangerous but guns are disrespectfully lethal in the hands of an incompetent loaf.

Pretty decent stand alone meme, but the FBI/CIA and text message templates are nothing new.
Those memes died in 2015
This isn't quite a format buddy. I'm sorry :(
 Then  instead of  than , I won't invest a penny.

I could see this growing a little, but not blowing up. It blends two memes, but one of them is starting to get stale. All in all, average meme. It will grow a little, but make sure you sell it before it crashes.

So I’m lost as to how the commands work with the investor bot, and how you either gain or lose memecoins. Also how many do you start with or how do you get them in the first place?

stefan is reasonably likely to retain value for extended periods of time due to his legendary meme status. Resurrection however is likely to fail due to his death, do not expect it to come back as a classic. Aspects of edge factor may be lost as well.
This is oddly specific. You could do it with a few complicated memes, but not much versatility here.
Crop out tweet and replace labels with anything and this could be very profitable.
That must have been one hell of a cock slap.

Stop. Leave this site.
You invested with 1k upvotes already. The way the curve works is your investment needs to get 10-100 times the amount of upvotes to even out. So pretty much only invest in memes with less than 100 upvotes, 1 or 0 is best if you want to earn 3x back.
You invested too late.

I wish I could go back in time and fuck Hitler’s brains out.

This is how I envision it: I’m a dirty little american soldier that ends up being captured by the Nazis. To avoid execution, I volunteer myself to be Hitler’s obedient fuck-toy.

For days, I allow Hitler to chain me up and obliterate all of my orifices like they’re little Polands, constantly filling them with his aryan seed until his cock is stroked raw.

Hell, he even gives me the pleasure to lick his puckered german booty clean after he takes insane nuclear shits. Due to me not getting bathroom access, I constantly shit and piss myself, but Hitler is generous enough to be my personal cleanup, licking it all up and staining his beautiful mustache.

After building up trust and showing my obedience, he unchains me and allows me to fuck his brains out, cursing in pleasure as he yells out, “YA SHOVE IT REICH UP MY ASS!”. I’m generous enough to give him a reach around, cranking his throbbing war machine.

I feel him tighten up as he reaches climax, but I let go of his thick ramrod as he begins to spew his nuclear ejaculate all over the floor. Hitler repeatedly yells out “NEIN! NEIN! NEIN! NEIN!” through his moans while he suffers through his ruined orgasm. At this point the tables have turned.

He tries to fight me off, but I pin him down and powerfully thrust my all-american cock harder into his poop chute as blood begins to build up and gush out of his torn asshole. I can’t contain myself any longer, so I quickly pull out my 1911 and put a bullet through the back of Hitler’s head. Brain matter and skull fragments paint the wall, which makes me break through to my climax.

I raise my right arm up to the ceiling. I yell out “SEIG HEIL!” as my cock begins to rapidly pulsate. I quickly thrust my cock to the hilt deep inside of him. I throw my head back with a loud “FUUUUCK!” as I spew what feels like a gallon of american semen deep inside his german asshole.

I pull my bloody cock out of his booty tube and watch in excitement as my thick load begins to leak out of his ass. Heavily breathing, I fall back and begin to fade out, as I watch a group of american soldiers burst into the room, guns drawn.

I wake up in the hospital, in which I’m told that I’m praised as an american hero for stopping World War 2.
