Hey does anyone know where the 2017 Nov Chinese B SL and HL Paper 1 exams are? I can't seem to find them. 
AHH the Web page is down due to maintenance?
May i know when the IB servers will be up again or whether there are any emergency links? none of the links are working. 
Anyone has a pdf of November or May 2017 paper for Business Hl? Please share, appreciate your help :)
Do each versions of the question bank have a different set of questions, or do newer versions encompass the questions of older banks.

Wtf? All links are suspended? Tried opening some past paper links/EE exemplars and all of them are down.
It seems that the IB server is going offline quite frequently. A week ago it says under maintenance and I remembered that a while ago (2-3 months) the website was down for like 1 or 2 months. Not blaming you guys or anything, but why don't you guys just get a reliable provider like Wix or google sites?
is the website down for anyone else?

Out of respect for Templar and co, I have not posted the website but is it O.K to share that website to link the 2018 papers?

Finding this subreddit 2 years after I passed IB by a whisker 😭😭😭
Thank you so so much for this! This is such a lifesaver!  However, I have one question, is it somehow possible that for the question bank e.g. all topic 1 questions for biology could be merged into one document?  Doing it manually takes so long since there are (fortunately) so many questions. I am not able to figure it out to do it all in one go and it would be amazing if all the questions from one topic were in one accessible document.
Hey I can't quite find the "Various IB Useful Documents (Litcharts)" bit on the website.... Please let me know where it is on the website! Thank you so so much you're a lifesaver to many MANY (tbh all) IB students in the world :) 
Thank u very much! 
This really makes me feel happier!! 
OMG can't believe someone spent so much time on this! Thank you! Question Bank was so useful!
I can't seem to find Section 10 and 11 there. Assist please.
Hey, 

just wondering, will there be updates of resources like questionbanks and textbooks when the new IB syllabus for maths come out soon in around May?
Where can I find solved question papers. Like the entire answer there and not just markscheme. 
Need it for Economics specifically. 
I need resources for the Computer Science Option B (Modelling and Simulation). 
Thanks 👊👊👍

yeah we Aussies got ours today, my school had 8 45's, I got 44

&#x200B;
It’s supposed to be out today? Not the 5th...
Somehow i got a B in my physics EE
One mark away from a 4 in physics and 2 marks away from a 5 in math. Should I request for a remarking?
i got a 35 THANK GOD!!! also i got a 6 for History HL so i’m kind of in shock right now. what’s annoying is that for four subjects i’m only a few marks away from a higher grade, ditto for EE and TOK, so i’ll probably remark. thank you IB gods, i’ truly been blessed. 
is a C in EE a bad thing? i got B for TOK so overall 2 bonus points, with 44 points total. i hope to apply for medicine so i was wondering if getting a C for my EE is bad for it. 
I got a fucking 5 from English A Lang and Lit SL. I was predicted a 7, and I was %99.999 sure I was gonna get it. Let alone a 5, it never even crossed my mind that I would get a 6. I am so FUCKING mad. Other than that, everything was as I expected and I got a 41... but that 5 makes the difference between 43 and 41, which is probably life-changing for me at the moment. 

Fuck the IB. I gave it my everything and it gave me a 41. I don't know how I'll feel in a month or a year, but right now it is so not worth it.
idk how i got 6 in math hl when i solved like 35% on paper 3
Okay, I'm kinda lost and confused. I'm a Croatian IB student and my results haven't yet appeared on the page (along with the other 14 people who took the exams in the Nov 18 session). However, our coordinator did get them and was able to tell some of us who he remembered that they passed. However, I still don't have my exact grades on the IB Candidates page. Are Croatia's results posted at a later date or is something going wrong with our accounts? If anyone has any answers it would be greatly appreciated. 
I’m missing 4 points because of the grade boundaries 😭😭😭 also, practically all of my school’s geography EE was a C and were a few points off a 7... I was wondering if anyone else experienced a similar phenomenon in their school?
> Jan 6 12:00 PM - You *finally* can get your grades 

does this mean grades of each individual assessment piece?
his name is sal khan, and i was sorta mind blown when i realized he does all the videos for all the subjects
Don't forget bioninja that thing will save your life one day.
spoiler alert: It doesn't change in college.

Richard Parina is saving my math studies ass on YouTube. I honestly love him.
His name is Salman Khan, founder of KhanAcademy. He has bachelors and masters degrees from MIT in electrical engineering, mathematics and computer science. He also has an MBA from Harvard. 

He left his job as a hedge fund manager to pursue his mission to provide world class education for all for free. 

Started making videos to tutor his cousins, he now helps millions of students worldwide access quality education especially those who don't have the means otherwise. 

And you, who are you again, you racist prick? 

Maybe you should rethink what you're getting from your overpriced IB education.
