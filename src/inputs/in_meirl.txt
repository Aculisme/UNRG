Just make sure to give them a solid good morning handshake as well. Keep this up for a few years and you'll be fine!
My folks may still remember the time I tried to wash paper plates 
good night mr dad, good night mrs mom
I give my parents goodnight fistbumps if I feel like it. 
i do. 
According to my parents, I once got so high that I tried getting into bed with them, I thought their bed was my bed. 
This is kinda cute but also kinda hard to imagine actually happening.  Maybe just cuz I have a different kind of relationship with my parents. 
That‚Äôs when people get suspicious üíÄ
My dad has always given goodnight handshakes. I guess he's permahigh.
Stole that joke hard lmao
Just tell them you were drunk, smh. 
Seen this one before, but I can relate and still gave it the thumbs up.
I do that tho...
This could be an acid thing
My mom simply guessed the reason why I was stirring the spaghetti pot so vigorously. She was right.  It was the devil's lettuce. 
If you smoke weed, they can smell that stench miles away.
When you realize they already saw you but carried on about their day because they gave even less of a shit about seeing you.
When you work in that store and have nowhere to run
Every [time](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2Sqc3POpzkj5r8SQ/giphy.gif).
it happened to me yesterday, oof
Thankfully people don't really recognize me, I look a lot less drugged out and don't wear pajamas everywhere anymore.
my ex next door neighbor was in the grocery yesterday.  despite trying not to, we directly passed each other 3 times.  we acted like complete strangers 
I bumped into my past teacher in the beer section of a grocery store... I guess she wanted to forget her job...
When I had moved back to my hometown after living elsewhere for a few years, there was someone that I recognized in a grocery store parking lot, but I didn't want to talk to them. They shouted my name and I just kept walking. That was a decade ago. It was a total success: haven't seen them since.
:/
I know this isn't right for the sub but today I saw a schoolmate's mother in the grocery and she helped me shop a bit since I'm not quite sure how to shop like an adult yet. Very wholesome and I'm glad she took the time to help me out.
N I G E R U N D A Y O ! !
One time in 9th grade I saw my teacher through the pallets at Sams club, he literally ran away
"You know too much about my awkward years. Bye."
When I see someone from high school I do the responsible thing and pretend not to notice
Why do we do this?
Highschool friend. Haha yeah right
Just moved back to my hometown and this is a constant occurance
Imagine being from a small town and there being a swarm of them.
yeah thats me, but then i realize they dont even recognize me :/
Everybody knows that 
I saw a girl I rejected in college standing in the shampoo aisle of Walmart. At the last second she looked up, and I just kept strolling by pretending I didn't see her 
Its weird how this happens...every.damn.time.
I moved pretty far away from home but I'm going back for Christmas this weekend. I have run across people from HS in the past but I've changed so much that they didn't recognize me
A real MEIRL ü§î
Lol
I do this with people I once knew and are still friends with on facebook but don't think they'll remember me.
LMAO, that is what I do everytime! Even with relatives too. If I haven't been seen, I go rushing in the opposite direction or hide behind the person whose shopping with me.
When I see someone anywhere
Same as when you see ur neighbor walking up the street and ur outside...
I just move.
I‚Äôm literally aspiring to move to the other side of the world, just so I don‚Äôt have to see anyone I know later on
I once saw a friend from high school at a coffee shop 2 years after we graduated, talked a little while, then she thought I was hitting on her because I asked for her number before saying bye, smh. Fuck high school
Guy I went to high school with and talked to for a year was working at the corner store a block from me.

When he said hey man, you remember me from high school... I told him sorry, I honestly don't remember people from college.

I went home and got out the yearbook then remembered he was a guy I talked to in biology class freshman year because he sat at my 5 group table.
Okay I can get behind this.
i saw someone the other day that i knew from somewhere but forgot where and what his name was and all that then we made eye contact and he gave me a similar look like he knew me from somewhere and then i sped up and walked faster basically like the pic
Skeletor! He-Man was my favourite show as a kid
This is totally me too.
Just walk up and say hi.

Doesn't hurt anyone. Even wave if you're not comfortable with speaking.
This literally just happened to me in the laundromat. He was reading a book really intensely not looking up, but he was right next to the door. I just walked right by him and outside and he never saw me.
Difficult to avoid contact when you're the cashier :(
I was working retail and saw someone I hadn‚Äôt talked to since elementary school. I basically hid behind the counter on the other side of the store... Probably wouldn‚Äôt recognize me since it‚Äôs been so long, but who knows because I recognized them.
Working in a store in my hometown in my twenties, this is me on the daily.
But they did notice you and think you are wierd for running or walking away.
Then I'd still have to talk to them and they would go into all the things they remembered me from.
nyah!
Faxes
I'll be right next to them and just not even acknowledge their existence 
Worst I've had it was getting in line at Khols when my ex GF of 2+ years was in line with her husband and kid in front of me.

We saw each other and I just walked out of line and went back to browsing for 30 minutes then went back up and paid for my stuff and left.

For those wondering, I didn't want to interfere with her new life.  I'm not sure what she told her husband about me but I broke up with her because I didn't want to settle down and get married or have kids at that point in my life.

She did all that within 7 months of us breaking up and had the kid 16 months later.

I'm glad for her ;p
[I was expecting this one](https://i.imgur.com/e8a5w9s.gifv)
This happened to me yesterday, hadn‚Äôt seen him in 10 years but we were kinda close in high school.  I noped out but I kinda have a feeling he saw me and he did the same thing.

I‚Äôm cool with that though
Skeletor is life!
Or the white person nod and smile that says "Yup, things did not end up working out for me, but atleast I am not homeless. Have a good day."
A N X I E T Y
Literally did this tonight at a local grocery store
I was at target and I saw 6 whole people from my school while we were at the registers
Me sorta kinda but people end up taking pictures with me instead :shrug: 
I saw my own cousin in the supermarket today and walked off in the opposite direction cos I hate bumping into people when I‚Äôm just trying to buy groceries 
I went to the beach once and maybe 7 girls from school were there. You can guess how much of a nervous wreck I was that entire day. Thankfully I was able to drag my family in the opposite direction and they didn't notice me, but still.
always the people I hate and never my crush
I do this with everyone I know. Not because I hate them, but because people stress me the fuck out in general and I don't know how to properly engage in small talk then break it off so I can finish my work and get home
Saw a guy from highschool at Starbucks, he saw me, went to order my drink, turned around and he ran. 
I actually still meet up with some people from high school here and there. Never on my own though, usually at parties. I was never really part of their group, but was friendly with most. Their whole group still hangs out, and they bring up the few "iconic" memories they have of me every time I see them. It's like there's a version of me forever stuck in the past with these people.
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt go a little out of your way to avoid these people? Couldn‚Äôt be me
Why is Reddit like this? I enjoy meeting people from back in high school and telling all my friends that know them what they are up to.
Miss me whit this pussy shit just come over and say yo how are you doing? Simple none of this loser ass scared shit
Cool idea but it implies that other people would actually bother to come to my funeral.

This is one of the greatest onion headlines ever created.

This looks like The Onion. Where I get all my useful news.
Griffin McElroy in 15 years.
It‚Äôs definitely a treat to see all of those fresh, rejuvenated faces turn to sullen disgust over the workday.
I think what made me realise I was quite fortunate is that over the Christmas/New Years period I actually missed my job. I see so many people unhappy with theirs on reddit and I just can't relate. It's not perfect. I'm not where I want to end up, but I'm getting there and in the mean time, it's enjoyable enough.

Best of luck to everyone in finding something better in the new year.

Guess who‚Äôs actually putting in their notice next wednesday?
I really don't want the holidays to end. The very thought of laying on my bed without worrying about school is so satisfying.
*gunshots erupt 
I will always upvote this 
It‚Äôs not so much a hatred for a job as it is a hatred for work. 
1-2 days: ready to get back to it. Feeling recharged 

2-7 days: nice mini vacation, gonna need another day or two to ease my myself into it 

7-14 days: I‚Äôm a slave to the system and I must unshackle myself from this corporate 4x4 
As a machinist coming back from break and doing inventory today.... cha feel. 
Which is why I said fuck it, used some vacation time and left at 4 this morning instead of staying til 8. 
Wait what vacation are we talking about?
Lmao
Damn I thought the Onion was supposed to be satire.
Saw this on r/funny some days ago when i was searching for some r/comedycemetery material
Oh man, this couldn't be more true today. 
Why would any news organizations make an article about this?

This was me all day in the office 
I‚Äôm pulling 66 hours this week because everyone else decided to extend their vacation. 

I relate to this man on at least three different levels. Maybe more as the week goes on.

Start of the show, ref does a ten count for all the fans.  Can't lose the title by count out so they all retain.

#Meme culture is just that guy in middle school who says your joke a little louder and the whole class laughs!

I remember that kid. His name was Matthew.

Matthew, if you're reading this: Fuck you.
It‚Äôs ironic bc Cole Sprouse for sure never went to middle school. 
Guess I should repost this?
The things I would do to you, cole 
Knew a guy like this named Julian. Except not only would he do this but he‚Äôd then say the joke so many times and make it his own thing, as a result losing the comedy completely and just becoming annoying. Don‚Äôt be like Julian.
Hey Patrick, you did this. Fuck you.

Man that's a whole lot of partages 
People say this on the 1st of every year
Dropped my laptop at 1 AM last night 

&#x200B;
Because 599 people have also already fucked up
The year.
Why does this post have 600 upvotes and just one comment? 
I bunked college and overslept today i.e. 1st Jan. Where I live, there's an urban superstition that you'll end up doing what you did on 1st Jan for the rest of the year too. I had fucked up on 1st Jan 2018 as well and that year literally nothing good happened with me.
Holy fuck it never dawned on me, 2020 is next fucking year? I need to get my life together 
Sounds about right. Might get fired tomorrow...starting the new year off with a bang I guess.
I woke up in a friends spare  room that had no doorknob.

Had to unscrew the handle holder thing entirely just to get out.

I was far to hungover to deal with that

Imagine if he'd been in some European country. Not only would EU workplace safety regulation have made it impossible for him to get attacked by a radioactive spider, he would also have gone to the hospital where they removed the radioactive spider stuff from his neck and he'd stay boring old Human-man
Something similar to this happened to me when I was younger. I got stung by a dozen bees out in the woods. I had my friends take me because I started feeling sick. Took a Tylenol and decided I was going to take a nap. My parents came home and promptly took me to the doctor. He told me that had I gone to sleep that I'd have died.
I don't think he took a nap I think he passed out.

I believe the teens these days refer to this as "a big mood".
No. That would be selfish and messy and I dont want to make a spectacle out of it.
Yes
No, my mom would be sad
Haha yes
haha yes
Call of the void says yes.  Thankfully I can say no.
yes PLEASE
No. Because trolleys probs would be derailed easily.

Now if its a cargo train that drivrs itself and has no one on board?


Idk maybe. Depends on my mood at the time. Not gonna say no, but rn Im not feeling it.

I thought The Trolley Problem was how to kill all 6 w out reversing 
Chidi?

Edit: spelling
Yes but I don‚Äôt live by any trolleys. Can the trolley come to me?
No.  Gotta calmly walk over and position yourself in the right place to do the most damage in the shortest amount of time.  Jumping leaves too much to chance.
Of course you do. Population control doesn't just happen on it's own, they need a leader to start the ball rolling!
Is my mom still alive? If yes, no because I don't want to make her sad. 
Oof, relatable
10/10 would jump in front of the trolley.
Will mom get sad?
The old ‚Äúsave a life, kill a murderer‚Äù dilemma
Why jump in front of the trolley when I can wave to the driver and see if I can‚Äôt get them to ring the trolleys bell?
That just traumatizes everyone onboard and creates a ripple effect of delays, nah. Take one of those new fancy self driving cars and program it to hit me instead. No guilt for anyone that way.
My mom would be sad tho
yes

I subconsciously always cover for myself with words like "idk", "maybe", "I guess", & structure my sentences in certain ways that it's never my fault. Apparantly it's a great way not to take any responsibility for anything I do & I've been ruining my life with this strategy :)

I just now realized that a real life shy guy would be very weird and scary
This is kinda youirl, so...
I once took a thermometer to the shower to see what's the difference between "warm, me like" and "fuck it burns"

It's 5¬∞C for me. (42¬∞C-47¬∞C) 
I did this and I got to the hottest temp and I was just standing there for so long thinking how much of a god I am that I didn‚Äôt even feel the water anymore and then I tried to make my self go into shock so I put it ay the coldest 
Im mr. heat miser
Some people just wanna see the world burn
Do you want dry skin? This is how you get dry skin
It's because the water feels colder after a moment 
I didn‚Äôt know so many other people do this nice 
Bold of you to assume the temperature of the shower would go up bit by bit
I always go full power, no cold water involved.
And then the hot water tank gives up
I do this but reversed
Just set it to the max to begin with 
Does anyone know where to find the gif of this Elmo? Or what the context is for this?

Isnt this how you cook frogs or something?
Taking a cold shower then changing your mind
I just put it all the way up a the beginning but ok
Protip:if the hot water is at max, further spice things up by turning down the cold water.
Is it weird that I prefer the hottest temperature that I can handle? I don‚Äôt want a medically classified burn, but pretty damn close. I‚Äôm typically red when I get out. Every so often I‚Äôll even switch to the coldest temp back to the hottest temp. 
The planet irl
Weakness, you always jump to the hottest setting. 
Doesn't everyone do this always? I dont think i have ever taken a shower without constantly raising the temperature
If you really want a challenge, move to Chicago in the winter. Take a shower and open your bathroom window, then turn the shower to the coldest setting, I‚Äôve done this and I felt like I was at the fucking North Pole.
I like to leave my hand in the pot when boiling water to see at what point I become pussy.

I call this "feeling the burn" and it baffles my fiancee how hot I can have it
Literally me 5 minutes ago. I always do this. It's soothing
I had a friend in college who did this, don't do this. He kept turning it up and up, turns out he did it slow enough where he couldn't feel his skin burning. I never saw the scars, but I felt real bad because he was clearly self-conscious of how bad they were for the next two years.

I do this but i decrease the temperature. Cold showers are quite healthy apparently so i wanted to try it
I just love this sub
I usually turn the water up to max hot and slowly lower it until I like the temperature before I get into the shower. I'll slowly turn the water towards cold at the end of my shower until it feels almost too cold and end it there. Otherwise the heat and steamed up bathroom can make me feel like I'm starting to sweat while I'm drying off and I don't like that.

And everyone keeps answering the question wrong and just before you build up the courage, someone finally answers
And when you have a good day and the question seems like one where you call an answer out. You call out the right one but no one hears you and then someone copies you and they‚Äôre heard. 
I was the ‚Äúannoying‚Äù one who would always answer after the 5 seconds of silence so we could fucking move on from every question.

Idk if others thought that of me, but Christ I‚Äôm just trying to help all of us, buds.

Still kick myself every time I think about it

To top it off, you have to sit in awkward silence for an hour because no one else seems to know the answer
>self-diagnosed social anxiety

FTFY
Literally just talk, you will undoubtedly sound like an idiot sometimes but you will care more than anyone else will
answer questions more often and you wont have so much anxiety when answering questions.

youre anxious because you're inexperienced, not because there's something wrong with you
Me when I was in the witness stand during a mock trial for our history class. I got tongue tied for a simple question, and I got impeached as a result :(
It‚Äôs even worse when you feel this way, somehow muster up the courage to raise your hand and get called on, only to find out you are wrong. 
I had a SpongeBob movie shirt as a kid with I think the logo on the front and for some weird reason it had that veiny Plankton on the sleeve

I wish that I'd understood what social anxiety was when I was a kid. I was mean and just figured people that didn't answer the teacher either weren't paying attention to the teacher or were kinda dumb.

Whenever I get like this I just stare intensely at my teacher until they pick me 
That was my all of school. Unfortunately I didn't know I had social anxiety until my wife pointed it out in my late 20's. I thought it was normal lol, man I coulda fucked soo many more girls if I was more self-aware of my anxiety. 
When you dont know the answer and the teacher calls on you and you have social anxiety.
When you have social anxiety but don‚Äôt know any answers.
Or you've studied for once, bulit up the courage and answered correctly one too many times, so the teacher bans you from further questions saying "Give others a chance" but others just sit there silently and the teacher gets pissed and gives extra homework to everyone. 
Social anxiety in your own class ??
I can't be the only one who spent enough time with my class to feel comfortable saying whatever I want in front of them.

or the opposite is, when the teacher asks a question and you confidently answer it because you think you knew and then turns out you're wrong.
we did a game with family on Christmas, uncles and aunts included, like, whole family. We played a game with questions and we lost even though I knew a lot of answers, I just could not get the answers out, or my teammates were louder & I got ignored..
More like not knowing the answer and getting called on even though you weren't raising your hand.
I feel so sad for this world...

I‚Äôm a teacher and I know a lot of students in my classes have troubles with this. That‚Äôs why I never let my students raise their hands to answer one of my question. I choose who answers it.

This is a great way to make sure every student can answer a question, and not just the smart and confident students.

Just about everyone has social anxiety. You are just a pussy.

Social anxiety lol
Why do a disproportionate number of people on reddit claim to have ‚Äúsocial anxiety‚Äù? 
Anxiety is an excuse. 
Those times when you actually get over your anxiety to answer the question only to realize it makes no actual difference and you still ultimately have anxiety anyway.
Start bluffing.

Teachers won't call on someone who always has their hand up. Put your hand up as much as possible.

Obligatory ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt as good as the book‚Äù, but seriously, it‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt even read it and played a game of telephone with a person that read it 3 years ago. They basically ended up making yet another apocalypse movie with the same tropey characters and bad decisions.

Isn‚Äôt the ending of the show when Tom and jerry suicide after being rejected by a girl

EDIT: link to vid

The top right one was from an episode where Jerry was trying to convince Tom he was insane. I can't remember the name of the episode but my point is that Tom didn't apply the noose on himself.

Edit: [found the episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Year_of_the_Mouse)
Great show, as a kid you root for Jerry but as you grow up you start noticing that Jerry is an asshole and Tom is not so bad. Then you notice you are just as depressed as Tom
Yeah I remember this time period on show. It was so sad. Tom was going through a depression because his show, the Tom and Jerry show, was getting cancelled because of a tweet he did about 10 years ago was accused by some article by WSJ for having Nazi references. 
bRO
Don't jump to conclusions. Maybe he just likes doing pharmaceuticals and autoerotic asphyxiation. 
Looking back, I definitely realize this show is dark af and understand why my mom didn't want me watching it

it's worse when she's sad and makes you feel incredibly guilty because you were gonna lose weight for her and then you didn't. Making her question if you truly love her, making yourself question it too while also knowing that you do and that those inner demons don't just go away like it's nothing

Sadstuff, without self-control you'll never fix that. It's hard to cut out shit food, but once you do it gets easier. Your gut bacteria are a big part of where your cravings come from. Once you starve out the ones that like fatty, suggary foods, the cravings vanish more or less

Haha yeah
I was so awkward on the only date ever and not talking. I took a very quiet moment to pull a lump of snot from my nose and just then, she, who was shy too, decided to hold my hand. So I'm there holding hands using 3 fingers and a thumb with my index finger sticking out, bogey attached. Now I'm thinking, if I can flick it, there's a larger chance it misses her leg than hits it. 
Do they?
I think fish only think about putting those fish sticks in that caviar if you know what I mean.

If you play against Burger Mii in Smash with Wario, Kirby, Yoshi or King Dedede you can eat the burger.
And you don‚Äôt even own a Nintendo
When I first got my Switch I did look up how to make specific Mii's like Ganondorf, Rick (Rick and Morty), Zoidberg, etc. It is really fun how creative you can get.

>Orson Welles: I hate Woody Allen physically, I dislike that kind of man.

>Henry Jaglom: I‚Äôve never understood why. Have you met him?

>Orson Welles: Oh, yes. I can hardly bear to talk to him. He has the Chaplin disease. That particular combination of arrogance and timidity sets my teeth on edge.

>Henry Jaglom: He‚Äôs not arrogant; he‚Äôs shy.

>Orson Welles: He is arrogant. Like all people with timid personalities, his arrogance is ¬≠unlimited. Anybody who speaks quietly and shrivels up in company is unbelievably ¬≠arrogant. He acts shy, but he‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs scared. He hates himself, and he loves himself, a very tense situation. It‚Äôs people like me who have to carry on and pretend to be modest. To me, it‚Äôs the most embarrassing thing in the world‚Äîa man who presents himself at his worst to get laughs, in order to free himself from his hang-ups. Everything he does on the screen is therapeutic.
used to be like that when I was 16, took acid a few times and now I'm a better person :)

Idk how to explain this but I love how I can tell which ones the grandma and which ones the grandpa
"So what are you studying?"

"Computer science" (or, directly translated, "Informatics") 

"Im not sure what it does. What will you do for work?"

"Uh. So this is a computer" (My great aunt has one!)

"Yes"

"And when you turn it on, you have various programs you can do stuff with?"

"Right"

"So i would be writing similar programs"

"Ohhhh! Thats amazing!"
Wish I had grandparents
My parents look at me like this when I try to explain Ecommerce. 
The way they look at you when you tell them there is a folder for pictures on their phones for the 17th time and you know they still don't understand a word of what you saying.
> supportive grandparents

Haha 
This frustrates me so much. 
Y is it so hard for people to understand the difference between "you are" and "your"??

Harry Potter would be a die hard movie, not the other way around 
Never even watched the movie but isn't he actively searching for Alan Rickman? 
Many years ago, [Cracked made this joke](http://s3.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/7/0/0/166700_v3.jpg).

He‚Äôs in no way avoiding Alan Rickman. 
Actually, Harry Potter and Die Hard are Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves movies. It doesn‚Äôt get more ‚Äúrunning around towers, avoiding Alan Rickman‚Äù than that!

Why is there a vignette on a screenshot
"Snape... Buh-bby... I'm your Black Knight"
Change my mind
My first instinct was to read this like the rat song from rat movie: mystery of the mayan treasure.
Why‚Äôs it look like someone printed out a tweet and scanned it back in??
It's not a coincidence that I can't watch either with being maximum arousal.
Nah Harry Potter a die hard movie. 
alan rickman's dead :C
If you have to explain the joke, the joke is not good at all.
He also has a plus sized ally outside who allegedly killed a kid once.
I'm from Germany and I read "die"  as in the german "the" and my mind tried to make sense of this for a long minute damn  
Haven‚Äôt watched die hard yet and I will never watch harry potter so I‚Äôll trust him
The shit show that is Harry Potter would love to be 1/10th that is Die Hard.
I feel like this is either excellent satire or the worst thing I've ever read
You fool. Harry is a die hard movie not the other way around!
Jake Peralta just found his favourite crossover
Fuck it, pretty soon we‚Äôre just gonna start calling December ‚ÄúDie Hard Season‚Äù. Is it just me or did we hit a new peak for Die Hard talk this year?  It‚Äôs a decent flick but the whole thing is exhausting

I actually kinda did this when I used to walk to school, id take different routes at certain times bc I slowly learned the routine of people I wanted to avoid lol
Had to do this when a bus driver that runs a route that goes from my place (literally right there) to my PT had been harassing me. Straight up refused to let me off the bus one day until I came up to the front door so he could give me his number, even after having asked if I was single and me telling him I had a partner.

He's currently fighting his punishment (I wasn't allowed, per his contract, to know what the punishment was, but it sounded like this wasn't the first time) with his union. I may need to testify. The supervisor he answers to gave me the schedule he'd be running for the next three months. 
You know, you‚Äôre not going to get many upvotes but I want to let you know this post made my day.
