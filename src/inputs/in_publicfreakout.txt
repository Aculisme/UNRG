Good on the officer for making sure his target‚Äôs foreground and background were clear before firing.

There are other videos from a little earlier where the guy with the shopping cart gets involved
Two more stabs than they should have given him. 
I'm sorry, you tried to stab me? I'm definitely going to shoot you.  
The media said this was a terrorist attack,  as you can see on the video the man has mental issues a
